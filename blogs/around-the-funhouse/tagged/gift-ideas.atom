<p>March Break is coming up and it's a great time to spend some quality time with the family. Candy Funhouse shares some ideas on how to make it even more special – even while staying safely at home!</p>

<h1><span style="color: #609f0d;">MARCH BREAK IS COMING!</span></h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Times may have changed, but people have not. After working so hard we all need a vacation, even if that means a Staycation! Time off work, time to catch up on some Netflix, maybe dust off the winter blues and start thinking of springtime ahead... with candy by your side!</p>
<h2>Here are some ways to make March Break happen for the whole family:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Game night. Every night! </strong> Schedule a game night with your family, and make your games revolve around candy. Our Candy Funhouse team put together this candy game blog <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/bring-in-the-new-year-with-candy-games" target="_blank" title="candy games" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>[HERE]</strong></a> with lots of sweet ideas to tie in with. Everyone loves a good game night, schedule it in!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.52.51_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803197" alt="" width="388" height="303"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>March Break around the world.</strong> Pick a country or region and dress up with that theme... One country per day = 7 days of fun! Make your candy online purchase selection match the different countries you're picking. For example, on "Mexican Day" you can have a taco dinner night, then <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/doritos-3d-crunch-chili-cheese-nacho-326g" target="_blank" title="3d nacho chips" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Doritos 3D Crunch Chili Cheese Nacho Chips</strong></a> while watching a Mexican film, followed by <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/efrutti-mexican-dinner" target="_blank" title="efrutti Mexican" rel="noopener noreferrer">efrutti Mexican Dinner</a></strong> gummies!  Candy Funhouse has online candy sales from Japan, British candy, Australian candy, and of course our very own Canadian candy - and this is cause for celebration!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.46.33_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803087" alt="" width="221" height="220"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.45.26_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803112" alt=""><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Celebrate Spring.</strong> March 20th is the first day of spring, so why not celebrate it early and get the family going on springtime fun-time? You can get the smaller kiddoes planting some seeds and for every seed they plant they get a special treat! On another day, take the kids on a drive to look at some of the early blooms surrounding the neighbourhood, like daffodils, crocuses and tulips - then they can match the colours they see with a colourful candy! Here are some favourites, including Australia's <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/australian-candy/products/lifesaver-tingles-fruit-aus-34g-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lifesaver Fruit Tingles</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-tropical-candies-61-5-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles Tropical</strong></a> candies, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jelly-belly-kids-mix-3-5oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jelly Belly Kids Mix</strong></a>, or even <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bigs-cheese-burger-sunflower-seeds-152-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bigs Cheese Burger</strong></a> sunflower seeds, which they'll love!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.59.37_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803770" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.00.40_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803787" alt=""><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.04.42_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803901" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.01.41_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803806" alt=""><br><br>

      <![CDATA[<p>Okay love birds: Some of us know that gifting anything for guys is just such a challenge – what do you get a man who won't fall for the fully gift-types, or maybe he's picky about clothing, or he already buys himself everything he needs? Short answer: <em>SWEETS</em>!</p>
<p>Candy Funhouse has put together some great ideas for you, so don't delay and order your candy online today in time for the most romantic day of the year!</p>
<p>What do you think about these BEST Valentine's Day gifts for men?</p>
<h3>Colour code it!</h3>
<p>Some guys are drawn to a particular colour because it may be their favourite team's colour, for example. Our friend Shirley shared her clever idea [<a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/320881542183672516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>] and we thought it was brilliant! Dare to be different by going BLUE rather than the typical RED for V-Day!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/320881542183672516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-01-18_at_11.17.43_AM_240x240.png?v=1610986790" alt="" width="386" height="483"></a></p>
<p>Some great ideas for BLUE treats for Valentine's Day include <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/maynards-sour-patch-kids-blue-raspberry-141g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sour Patch Kids Just Blue Raspberry,</strong></a> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/hersheys-kisses-cookies-and-cream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hershey's Kisses Cookies and Cream</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/brookside-dark-chocolate-acai-with-blueberry-7oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry,</strong></a> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/chips-ahoy-hersheys-chocolate-chip-cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chips Ahoy! Hershey's Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong></a> (great combo!) savoury and crunchy <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/copy-of-chex-mix-traditional-mix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Traditional Chex Mix</strong></a>, and when's the last time you've enjoyed the super-delicious taste of Kool-Aid's Blue Raspberry Lemonade Drink?!!</p>

<h3><strong>Say it with chocolate!</strong></h3>
<p>We all like chocolate, right? Whether it's white, dark, milk chocolate, chocolate-covered pretzels or licorice, chocolate remains the KING of Valentine's Day. Remember seeing these "chocolate bar sayings" online? This is one of Candy Funhouse's favourites – well done Rebekah!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"> At Candy Funhouse we have a big following of bakers, and Valentine’s Day is one of the best ways to get right into baking with some favourite toppings!</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you’re planning on baking some cookies, cakes, or special treats for those you love this Valentine’s Day, what better way than to add special toppings that they wouldn’t be expecting… and ship these cookies overnight to your loved ones at the safety of their own home (or office!).</p>
<p class="p2"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-20_at_2.36.47_PM_480x480.png?v=1608493038" alt="" width="520" height="348"></p>
<h2 class="p1">EASY SUGAR COOKIE RECIPE</h2>
<p class="p1">The dough can be a simple sugar cookie, and here is one of our favourite recipes you can start with as your base, before your add Candy Funhouse’s huge collection of sweet cookie toppings - check them out <strong>[<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/baking-toppings" target="_blank" title="toppings" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>]</strong></p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>2-1/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>3/4 cup of butter, softened to room temperature (don’t microwave it!)</li>
<li>3/4 cup of sugar (white or brown, either one is fine!)</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (or you can try orange extract, it’s delicious!)</li>
<li>lemon rind (optional, for that extra zing!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Method:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a medium sized bowl, mix the first 3 ingredients and set aside</li>
<li>Using a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and smooth – it should look a bit lighter and fluffier. Then add the egg, extract, and rind if using.</li>
<li>Then, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix on low until well combined (if the dough is too soft you can refrigerate it for 30 minutes, divided into 4 sections, in some plastic wrap).</li>
<li>Here’s where you can add some topping INSIDE the cookies, if you want! (See below for options).</li>
<li>Heat oven to 350°F.</li>
<li>Proceed to roll the dough out on a floured surface, and shape cookies.</li>
<li>Arrange on a baking sheet that has been covered with parchment paper, and bake for 10-12 minutes until lightly browned.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Once your cookies are cooled and the icing has been spread onto them, let the sweet fun begin! Here are some great options for toppings you can add to your Valentine’s Day cookies:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/baking-toppings/products/oreo-cookie-crumbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OREO Cookie Crumbs</a></h3>
<p class="p1">One of the most traditionally delicious cookies also comes in a crumb form, for your to add to your Valentine’s Day cookie before baking. Imagine biting into that delicious homemade sugar cookie and tasting the sweet OREO crumb inside… yum! </p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-20_at_2.04.26_PM_240x240.png?v=1608492542" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Sprinkles are like the fairy footprints on a cookie – it makes it that much more special! Choose from either chocolate or coloured sprinkles, or combine them both for some extra fun looking cookies!</p>
<p class="p1"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-20_at_2.04.41_PM_240x240.png?v=1608492626" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-20_at_2.09.04_PM_240x240.png?v=1608492643" alt=""></p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we are <strong>BIG on LOVE!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></strong>Although Valentine’s Day is February 14th, we like to think we can celebrate love and kindness all year round – especially this coming year! </p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons why we celebrate Valentine’s Day – it’s tradition, it’s history, it’s exciting, it’s a whole month of celebrating those you love!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_2.57.55_PM_480x480.png?v=1607371102" alt="" width="516" height="345"></p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to limit your Valentine’s Day celebrations to just a ‘special someone’. Many people may not have a significant other, they may choose to live the single lifestyle – and we think that is just swell as long as that’s what makes you happy!</p>
<p class="p1">You can order some candy online from Candy Funhouse, just because it’s the BEST way to get it: By mail! Imagine looking in your mailbox and seeing that your online candy order has arrived? Woo-hoo!</p>
<p class="p1">These past few months have been a challenge for all of us, plus it’s Winter so it’s not always to visit family and friends. Let them know you are thinking about them and order some candy, treats, and chocolates online now so they get it way before Valentine’s Day arrives! Beat the rush, surprise them NOW!</p>
<h2 class="p1">Retro online candy for your parents:</h2>
<p class="p1">Candy Funhouse’s extensive collection of vintage and nostalgic (retro!) candy will remind them of their youth, of what their parents would bring home for them, of times past… And this is always a nice feeling, right? Here are some ideas for those aged 45+ that you’d want to surprise for Valentine’s Day, including</p>

Here are some candy - and non-candy - ideas for your last-minute shopping.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/best-stocking-stuffer-ideas">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s that time of year, and what a year it has been! At Candy Funhouse we’re all about making those around you happy – and what better way than celebrating Christmas with candy!</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you started your Christmas shopping early at your local retailers, or if you finished ordering your gifts online, Christmas is never quite complete without the traditional stocking stuffers.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.05_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256722" alt="" width="531" height="355"></p>
<p class="p1">Christmas stockings have been around for centuries, and they’re the “bonus” that many kids – and adults! – look for on Christmas morning. Customs vary from country to country, for example, in many Asian countries it is still customary to give your friends and loved ones apples, which have been lovingly and creatively decorated and wrapped in pretty, colourful paper. Love that! And in Mexico, the Christmas piñata is still practised, with toys and candies abound.</p>
<p class="p1">We still prefer the stocking, and filling it can seem like a challenge… Until you check out Candy Funhouse’s Best Stocking Stuffer ideas for Christmas! Here are the top 12 ideas for what to put in your stockings this year:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">1. Cosmetics</h3>
<p class="p1">Not just for teens, but for moms and dads too! A specialty shaving kit for dad, a fancy night cream for mom, a new special sparkly nail polish for sis, and how about a fun little soap set for the toddler?</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Socks, of course!</h3>
<p class="p1">A stocking wouldn’t be quite the same without some new fun socks! Wrap them separately and make them UNmatchable… Because, who says socks have to match? Give each one of your kids a sock that doesn’t match, and let them figure it out!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.52_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256776" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Favourite fruit</h3>
<p class="p1">Add their favourite fruit – like a mango, a passion fruit, kiwi, or something different from abroad they may never have tried, like a lychee fruit, a pomegranate, or a star fruit. It’ll make for fun conversation too! Fruit has been stuffed into a Christmas stocking for AGES, why stop now?</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Jewelry</h3>
<p class="p1">It doesn’t have to be fancy, but even the smallest token of jewelry makes everyone smile! Like a button pin, different kind of earrings they’d never buy for themselves, cufflinks for the guys, or a cute little pendant.</p>
<h3 class="p1">5. Hair stuff</h3>
<p class="p1">We all need these, and we all run out of these – especially if you like doing ‘stuff’ with your hair! How about a new hairbrush, clips, and new fancy hair elastics?</p>
<h3 class="p1">6. Cards</h3>
<p class="p1">That’s “playing cards” for you! There are tons that are even sold at the local dollar store with different pictures on them, from Barbie to My Little Pony, Star Wars to the all-popular Yoda.</p>
<h3 class="p1">7. Eco items</h3>
<p class="p1">With the eco-craze going on right now, and since we’re all trying to avoid plastics, how about adding some paper straws to your stockings? There’s also traveling cutlery sets, and reusable collapsible cups. Help out Mother Earth this Christmas too!</p>
<h3 class="p1">8. Pet items</h3>
<p class="p1">They probably won’t get their own stocking, so why not add one item per stocking for each of the family members? This way, they can give it to Spot or Fluffy themselves: Like a specialty dog biscuit, a dog brush, or a new cat toy.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.26.36_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256823" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">9. Toothbrush</h3>
<p class="p1">This one deserves its own mention, as we really should be changing our toothbrush more often folks! Christmas time is the perfect time to invest in a new toothbrush for each family member. Goodbye germs, hello sparkly teeth!</p>
<h3 class="p1">10. A new subscription</h3>
<p class="p1">There are so many great magazines being published out there, and something for everyone! Get them a copy of it, roll it up, and subscribe them to the latest online edition! We all need less time on our iPhones, and more time off to unplug. Plus, a subscription is the gift that keeps on giving year 'round!</p>
<h3 class="p2">11. Handmade IOUs</h3>
<p class="p2">This is one of our favourites, because it’s made by YOU! Create a little set of “IOUs” that they can redeem on a once-per-month basis: Redeem for a kitchen chore, a bathroom cleanup, raking the garden, or even for a kiss! The possibilities are endless, and these IOUs can make for the best gifts of all. Get creative! You know what they’ll love! Whether working IOUs, romantic IOUs, funny IOUs, they're such a lovely gift to receive (and fun to make!).</p>
<h3 class="p1">12. Candy: OUR FAVOURITE!</h3>
<p class="p1">Of course we had to make this our BEST Christmas stocking stuffer idea of all time! Here are some of our favourites for this year:</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">We love having good relationships with other people who are special to us, and that’s why it’s so important to show our appreciation. Whether with a smile, a simple thank you note, a hug, or a special little gift, letting someone know you’re thinking of them and you care can make life that much sweeter – for both them and you!</p>
<p class="p1"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.20.22_PM_480x480.png?v=1603135250" alt="gift giving candy funhouse" width="525" height="340"></p>
<p class="p2">Candy Funhouse knows that it’s sometimes difficult to know how to share your appreciation for others. Sometimes it seems they have everything, or that somehow gifting them a sweater or some flowers will not reflect how much you care for them. Instead, consider candy as a gift, just because at Candy Funhouse we are specialists on gift-giving, and we have the best of online shopping right here for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Candy makes a great gift because there is something for everyone on your gift-giving list. Whether for their birthday, Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, for Thanksgiving, or even for Christmas, where the gift of candy goes back centuries as the perfect gift idea for anyone! <strong>Check it out:</strong></p>

<h2 class="p1">Candy on the tree</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/845410161270092652/" target="_blank" title="Christmas tree candy ideas by Tyler Hensley" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/chistmasTreeIdeas_480x480.jpg?v=1603133076" alt="christmas tree ideas" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; float: left;"></a></div>
<p class="p1">In medieval times, many Europeans had the tradition of adorning their Christmas trees with food: Wafers, cookies, even fruits and licorice were customary decorations to use.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s face it, candy was a delicacy and a treat even then, it was very special! And a great time of year for enjoying candy was when everyone got together to celebrate.</p>
<p class="p1">There are many more delicious candies you can hang on a Christmas tree, like these:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/pez-christmas-ornament-with-mini-dispenser" target="_blank" title="pez christmas" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PEZ Christmas Ornament with Mini dispensers:</strong> </a>What a great idea for starting out a Christmas tradition! They're peanut-free, gluten-free, and they look so good on a tree!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/pez-christmas-ornament-with-mini-dispenser" target="_blank" title="pez ornaments" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_2.47.48_PM_240x240.png?v=1603133396" alt="pez christmas ornaments"></a></p>

<p class="p1"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Birthday sweetness</h2>
<p class="p1">Same goes for birthdays: Sure, you may look forward to the gifts and the cake, but candy is always KING! Wouldn’t you like to get one of these gifts for your birthday? We’re sure you would!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_2.55.26_PM_480x480.png?v=1603133755" alt="birthday party candy treats" width="518" height="345" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_2.56.43_PM_240x240.png?v=1603133827" alt="birthday candy bar" width="292" height="197" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at this child’s birthday party candybar, pictured above. It’s clean, simple, oh so pretty in pink! And you would really have to do so little to make it look amazing. It would be as simple as decorating with a lovely white or pink  tablecloth, a pink or fuchsia cake, and some white dishes with the following candies:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/haribo-chamallows-uk" target="_blank" title="haribo chamallows candy funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Haribo Chamallows:</strong></a> Deliciously soft and fluffy pink and white marshmallows, from the UK! (And when you're gifting them, you BET they probably have never tried such good candies!). </p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/haribo-chamallows-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.00.22_PM_240x240.png?v=1603134038" alt="haribo chamallows candy funhouse" width="174" height="220"> </a><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/gustafs-pink-lemonade-laces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.02.35_PM_240x240.png?v=1603134177" alt="gustafs pink lemonade laces" width="205" height="123"></a> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.06.40_PM_240x240.png?v=1603134426" alt=""></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/gustafs-pink-lemonade-laces" target="_blank" title="pink lemonade laces licorice" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gustafs Pink Lemonade Laces –</a> Not only they are deliciously refreshing, but they make a great gift since they're SUCH FUN! Don't they look pretty in pink? You could even spell out words on the party table with them... and then eat them! </p>
<p class="p2">Candy Funhouse also carries lots of other PINK and WHITE candies to complete the gift-giving idea for your favourite person's party... Such as the <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/dum-dums-color-party-light-pink-bubble-gum-lollipops-75-ct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Light Pink Bubble Gum lollipops</strong></a> from Dum Dum's, lots of flavoured <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/pop-rocks-bubble-gum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POP ROCKS</a> Bubble Gum Popping Candy</strong> flavours, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/gummy-bears-strawberry-banana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Albanese Strawberry-Banana Gummi Bears</strong></a> (they're white!), good old fashioned <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bonomo-turkish-taffy-vanilla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bonomo Turkish Taffy</strong> </a>in Vanilla flavour, and beautifully delicious <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=jelly+belly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jelly Belly</a></strong> candy – available in pink grapefruit, bubble gum, and cotton candy for that delicately pink colour!</p>
<h2 class="p1">The gift that keeps on giving for 12 months!</h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/candyfunhouse-care-package" target="_blank" title="snack subscription" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_2.34.46_PM_480x480.png?v=1603132524" alt="candy subscription" width="529" height="499"></a></p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate and give thanks to people in our lives. Whether to your spouse for making this a special year, to your kids for being so supportive, or even to a friend or boss who has been especially awesome with you! Why not give a sweet candy thanks this year?</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine being on the receiving end: There is something very special about getting a candy basket filled with treats! You can send someone a card (and those are always nice to get!) but don’t forget that the gift of candy makes everyone smile.</p>
<h2 class="p2"><strong>Here are some ideas that will make them smile and truly feel your gift of thankfulness:</strong></h2>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=chocolate" target="_blank" title="chocolate lover Candy Funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the chocolate lover:</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Some people are just the chocolate-lovin’ kind. For them, why not pick a brand like Valor and gift them a chocolate variety? You can select from Dark Chocolate Truffle Cream, the Orange Cream, and a Milk Chocolate Sugar-Free, sweetened with Stevia and perfectly healthy!</p>
<p class="p1">Milka is another delicious brand of candy bars that offer a variety of flavours, like DarkMilk with Almonds, Bubbly White Chocolate, Brownie Chocolate, or Medley – a delightful medley of dark chocolate chips, biscuits and fudge pieces. Which ones would they eat first, or maybe they’d have a square off each!</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-09-14_at_2.33.34_PM.png?v=1600108554" alt="thanksgiving Candy Funhouse chocolate" width="530" height="252"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=vegan+candy" target="_blank" title="Vegan candies" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the Vegan:</a></h3>
<p class="p1">If you have a friend who follows a Vegan diet, they will really appreciate the thoughtfulness you put into this Thanksgiving gift!</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at Candy Funhouse’s large collection of Vegan candies, and pick a few favourites to make an assortment into a beautiful basket. With us, buying an online candy gift for someone who has dietary preferences has never been easier! And if you're ever wondering which candies are Vegan, read our <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/vegan-and-vegetarian-candies-we-love" target="_blank" title="vegan and vegetarian candy funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>BLOG</strong></a> to find out more details about all the ones you can safely have!</p>
<p class="p2"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-09-14_at_2.40.28_PM.png?v=1600108856" alt="vegan candy funhouse" width="523" height="269"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=licorice+candy" target="_blank" title="licorice candy funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">Say ‘thank you’ with licorice!</a></h3>
<p class="p1">There are some people who like licorice and some who just LOVE IT. We bet you know someone who would love to get a surprise licorice gift, right? Flick through our licorice options and combine items that have different shapes, sizes, and flavours, like a package of <strong>Nerds Rope Very Berry</strong>, with a package of <strong>Red Vines Original Red Twists</strong>, and one from <strong>Crush Orange Licorice</strong> – bet they may not have ever tasted of one these amazing flavours!  <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-09-14_at_2.46.38_PM.png?v=1600109224" alt="licorice candy funhouse" width="540" height="313"></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=mint+candy" target="_blank" title="mint favourites candy funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mint Favourites:</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Not everyone likes chocolate (we’re not sure why!) but everyone likes a little mint flavour to freshen up their day! Wrap up a big thank you gift package with some mint flavour varieties, like <strong>Altoids Cinnamon Mints</strong>, <strong>Junior Mints Minis</strong> (they are sooo good and tiny!), and the well-beloved <strong>Life Savers Mints Pep O Mints</strong>. What a thoughtful Thanksgiving gift!</p>

<p class="p1">These special nostalgic candies are perfect to put in a basket for Thanksgiving dinner with the family, or to put on everyone’s place-setting as a little surprise right before the big meal. They’re also perfect to send to someone who is distanced from you, since you can’t share that special Thanksgiving meal with them!</p>
<p class="p1">Candy Funhouse has a huge selection of Vintage Candies for online ordering, such as <strong>Bottle Caps</strong> which date back to the early 70s, <strong>Candy Blocks</strong> (it’s so much fun to play with your food!) and <strong>Fun Dip Candy</strong> – remember dipping the stick into the powdered candy and licking it? Good vintage memories for sure!</p>

<p class="p1">Kids may be just about the sweetest reason to celebrate Thanksgiving. Don’t forget to send them a little ‘thank you’ candy! Why not send them something they can enjoy eating, but also playing with? Like the <strong>Candy Jackpot</strong>, the <strong>Water Blaster</strong> (with Dubble Bubble gum!), or the <strong>Formula 1 Racer,</strong> for zipping around the Thanksgiving table after enjoying the candy! Check out the Kidsmania link to see dozens of options for specialty-kid candy, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/vendors?q=Kidsmainia" target="_blank" title="kids specialty candy funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.</p>

<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">For the Tree Hugger – or for everyone, really!</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s face it: A tree hugger still loves their candy, they just don’t like the way in which it’s wrapped! Say a big ‘thank you’ to them this Thanksgiving by showing them you appreciate their efforts to be more eco-conscious, and wrap their candy gift in some fabric! Check out this <a href="https://www.bhg.com/christmas/gift-wrapping/wrap-gift-with-fabric/" target="_blank" title="better homes video fabric wrap" rel="noopener noreferrer">video from Better Homes &amp; Garden</a> to learn how you can easily do this:</p>

<p class="p2">At Candy Funhouse, we’re sure you have some people in your life who seem to have everything they’d ever want, right? It’s difficult to have a Thanksgiving get together when you’re having to ‘social distance’ this year… Instead, think CANDY gift giving, and make everyone realize how thankful you are to have them in your life!</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candy is something that never goes out of style. Adding a Candy Funhouse buffet could serve as an excellent wedding favour for your guests! This creative and fun way to engage your guests may seem like a simple project, but there is a lot more to it than you may imagine. A candy buffet or a wedding sweet table can be a fabulous focal point if you pay attention to the details, such as:</span></b></p>
<h3><b>How much candy to buy?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Candy Funhouse, our experience shows us that the rule of thumb - where candy buffet is concerned - is to keep a pound of assorted candy per 2 – 3 guests. You may need more if your candy favour bag is of a larger size. If your wedding planning is on a tighter budget, make sure you keep small-sized favour bags or containers to discourage overloading. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also reverse-calculate the amount of candy as per the container size. Purchase the containers first, and then identify the correct amount that will fill out the display. Make sure you pair the type of candy with container size. You want to use less expensive candy to fill up larger jars and the elegant specialty truffles for the smaller ones.</span></p>
<h3><b>The best containers to use in a candy buffet</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to stay true to your wedding décor while making things fun with a candy buffet. You would want to choose the right jars to make the buffet a fabulous display. Vases, large mason jars, fish bowls, and oversized glasses can be used to hold all the candy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedding experts suggest using different sized jars of various shapes to make the display more eye-catching. Visit your local thrift store to get glass vases at super cheap rates! Clear containers are recommended, because you want your guests to see the type of candy inside. Plus, clear containers are better when it comes to the aesthetic presentation of a wedding sweet table. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of jars depends on the guest list. Generally, it’s recommended to keep 5 jars for every 50 guests. So, if you have 200 guests coming, you should bank on 20 jars. </span></p>
<h3><b>Choosing the right favour packaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favour packaging is a must when planning a candy buffet. You want your guests to fill out the items they want in a compact, easy to handle packages. Generally, paper treat sacks, jars, miniature pails, clear bags and more are used in weddings candy buffet. You need to keep the favour package close to the buffet and somewhere it is seen easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/CandyFunhouse_favour_package_medium.png?v=1593187248" alt="Candy Funhouse favour bag" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<h3><b>Tips to set up an amazing candy buffet for your wedding</b></h3>
<p><strong><em>Follow your wedding colour theme</em><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candies come in fantastic shapes, sizes, and colours. You can add a pretty splash to the buffet table by adding candies that coordinate effortlessly with the overall décor. Your goal should be to create a show-stopping décor element while including all the popular varieties. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Consider your budget</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may want to go over-the-top with personalized chocolates and truffles, but let’s face it, weddings can be expensive and you may have to cut corners in some areas. The good news is that you can set up a lavish candy buffet at minimal costs if your wedding planning is just right. For instance, purchase your candies after a major holiday, like Thanksgiving or Easter - even at Candy Funhouse we may have special deals then! </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Buying in bulk is good</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can check out the candies in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/bulk-candy-canada">bulk</a> we offer at Candy Funhouse.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can score impressive deals and discounts by purchasing in bulk! You may just be able to include the more expensive varieties this way. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Don’t forget to mix and match</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your candy buffet doesn’t necessarily have to be about candy. It can include other tasty treats as well, such as marshmallows, nuts, pretzels, cookies, and more. The sky's the limit where variety is concerned. In fact, it is recommended to be versatile and flexible with your candy buffet. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Tongs and scoops keep things hygienic</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t want your guests passing around germs by using their hands to scoop out the candy, right? Scoops and tongs can keep things safe and hygienic so people can retrieve candy out of magnetic vessels. Make sure you keep multiple tongs or scoops at hand so that several people can make their selection at the same time. You could keep a utensil for each jar or vessel to allow guests to pick up their favourite treats or perhaps a treat they have never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever gone to a party where they had a Candy Buffet? Share your thoughts with Candy Funhouse!</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span>Candy Loot Bags For Everyone!</span></h2>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/loot-bags-candy-favours-for-birthday-parties-candy-funhouse-online-candy-store-canada.png?v=1505313884" alt="Loot Bags for Birthday Parties" width="387" height="387" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the host of any celebration, you may be feeling overwhelmed thinking about all the things to consider for a perfect eve: How many guests might arrive, which party favours to serve, how to decorate or which theme, and what about takeaways for guests? With so many choices and tutorials out there, it can feel tiring to find the perfect loot bag for every occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the help of loot bags not only can a party host create a great parting gift for their guests, but they can be certain they’ll remember what they received at the event in the future. In stores and online there are tons of different loot bag ideas available, however with the help of candy, and <strong>Candy Funhouse</strong>, you will make a sweet success out of your event!</p>
<h3><span>Loot Bags are Consumable... and Fun!</span></h3>
<p><span>When it comes to giving the perfect gift, edible gifts are often the most popular. These types of gifts can be the best thing for those who are against clutter and excessiveness. Sometimes people acquire too much when they go to special events like weddings, birthdays, and those mandatory corporate events. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<span><strong>Think about when a loot bag that you<br></strong></span><span><strong>were once gifted: <em>What was in it?</em></strong> </span>
</h2>
<p><span>Did you ever use the things you were given or were they discreetly given away? Something as simple as the gift of sweets can give everyone a smile. </span></p>
<p><span>Imagine the guests opening their loot bags and seeing that they received some of their favourite candies. Everyone has their own preference of candy, some like sweet candy, chocolates and some might enjoy sour candy, fruit licorice strips, or some sweet and sour candy could be in there. The possibilities are endless and everyone has their own taste. Candy is a simple and easy choice when it comes to consumable loot bag ideas.</span></p>
<h3><span>Candy Loot Bags are great for birthday parties</span></h3>
<p><span>Make it the best birthday ever on their birthday and send the guests home with a happy goody bag from Candy Funhouse, that kids and adults will love! Give these kids exactly what they’re craving with a bag filled with all sorts of yummy candy. Kids can be greeted at the door with a festive bag of goodies, and enjoy it before, during or after the party. Want to bring even more fun to the game? Create multiple party bags with different items and let them trade. Adults can play too, they need their own bags after all! Everyone loves candy. </span></p>
<p><span>Often kids are big fans of bubble gum, chocolate bars, and of course anything sweet. A common favourite in kids can also be sour candy. What do you think the little ones would like most at your event? Some sweets like M&amp;Ms, Nerds, and Runts? Perhaps they would like loot bags some Wonka Candy instead, or some super sour Lemon-Heads? With such a wide variety of candy on the market, you can’t go wrong with a little bit of everything for the kiddos.</span></p>
<h3><span>For those who love their Sweetheart</span></h3>
<p><span>While candy is often associated with holidays such as Valentine’s Day, it doesn’t have to be only for that day. There are many reasons to give your loved ones tasty treats for a gift. This could be for any day or a special occasion like an anniversary or a sweetheart’s birthday. <strong><em>Think of their favourite candy.</em> </strong>Put that thought into your mind. Now imagine a special bag at their desk, office, or home waiting for them. What a surprise they will be in for, and furthermore, you will score those brownie points since you remembered that special occasion!</span></p>
<p><span>Weddings, baby showers, and bridal showers have the same gift bag ideas normally, so step out of the box and get away from those boring party favour ideas. With these types of events, there are often a wide variety of novelty candies available. Lollipops in shapes of baby bottles or pacifiers for the baby shower; or to go a more non-traditional route, Bottle Caps can be in the loot bag. </span></p>
<h3><span>Retro Candy is Love</span></h3>
<p><span>Some of your favourite childhood candies might actually be older than you realize. For example, Boston Baked Beans are actually from the 1930s. The 3 Musketeers bar was brought into the candy world in 1932 and was one of the most available candy bars of its time. Getting further into nostalgic candies, remember those Mamba Fruit Chews you’ve seen at the grocery store? Those are alongside the M&amp;Ms brand making their debut in the 1950s. </span></p>
<p><span>Including some of the Retro candies above, party hosts can supply guests with some of their favourite classic and current popular candies. The Tootsie Roll was invented long before one might imagine; 1896! The original Pez Dispensers were brought to candy lovers back in 1950. Consider these loot bag ideas as the decades' party arrives. Wouldn’t it be a treat to have your classic throwback candy in a fun set of loot bags?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/loot-bags-candy-favours-for-corporate-events-candy-funhouse-online-candy-store-canada.png?v=1505313648" alt="Loot Bags for Corporate Events-Candy Funhouse"></span></p>
<p><span>With sweet companies come great ideas. Instead of having a boring old loot bag, with a lack of inspiration, have fun! Create your own party gifts by having an exciting loot bag filled with candy. Being able to choose what type of candies can be in a loot bag is one of the perks of custom loot bags. They can be as sweet as you want them, with the help of Candy Funhouse. All in all, it is a great rule of thumb to plan out the perfect loot bag ideas with the professionals. They will help everyone to stay sweet and love their parting gifts.</span></p>

Treat her to something nice as she sits down to drink her daily cup of joe with some classic British sweets like</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/snacks/products/walkers-mini-shortbread-fingers"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Walkers Mini Shortbread Fingers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/walkers-chocolare-chip-mini-shortbread"> </a><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/walkers-chocolare-chip-mini-shortbread"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chocolate Chip Mini Shortbread cookies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/walkers-chocolare-chip-mini-shortbread">.</a> At Candy Funhouse, we’re known for our vast selection of candy (obviously), but we also give our rad customers (like you) so many choices when it comes to delicious cookies, snacks, cereals, and more! Walker’s varieties of cookies are the perfect little snack that is deliciously smooth, sweet, and buttery. Plus, Walker’s has been in the cookie baking business since 1898 and have been dubbed “the world’s finest shortbread” so you know they’re doing something right.</span></p>
<h3><b>Perfect for the DIYer</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the best gifts are the ones you create with your own two hands. For this Mother’s Day, break out your markers, put your creative thinking cap on, and get crafting to do some DIYing for your mother. One of the best ideas our fun experts have seen on the interwebs are special, handwritten letters crafted with candy like this one:</span></p>
<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7f/c0/fc/7fc0fc6ef5eef7f3ce84d896dd6463ac.jpg" target="_blank" title="Gifts for Mother's Day " rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Mother gift" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7f/c0/fc/7fc0fc6ef5eef7f3ce84d896dd6463ac.jpg" style="float: left;"></a><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to incorporate your mom’s favourite candies as you spell out a special message like never before. It’s a great way to include classic candies as well as some new ones as you tell your momma that she’s worth a</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/100-grand-bar"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">100 Grand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or is the best mom in the whole</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/milky-way"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Milky Way</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don’t forget to mention that she’s</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/mounds"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mounds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of fun and brings so much</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/almond-joy-bar"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Joy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your life. Mention how much you would love to take her on a shopping</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/spree-theater-pack"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it wasn’t</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/payday"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Payday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet. It’s all about being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">punny</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and nothing is too corny for this type of gift. You could even sign the closing in a creative way by saying “from your</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/sugar-babies-theater-packs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar Babies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or the slightly silly “Love, your</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/airheads-taffy-cherry"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Airheads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” The options are endless!</span></p>
<h3><b>Perfect for the Kid at Heart</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give the gift that keeps on giving. Your mom will be the most popular gal in the office with one of our</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/toys-gifts/products/classic-gumball-machine-bank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Classic Gumball Machines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on her desk. She might be grown up, but these classic gumball machines speak to the kid in all of us. It’s the perfect size to fit on her desk, on the kitchen counter, or anywhere! Plus, there are so many sweet options to fill it with! You could go classic with</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=gumball"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gumballs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in almost any colour or take a new twist on an old classic and fill the gumball machine with</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/bulk-candy-canada/products/m-ms-milk-chocolate-candies-bulk"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">M&amp;M’s milk chocolate candies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you really wanted a sweet surprise, choose something unexpected such as</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/bulk-candy-canada/products/sour-blue-swirls-gummy-candy"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sour Blue Swirls Gummy candies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/bulk-candy-canada/products/sixlets-orange"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixlets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have a cocoa and carob center that gives it a distinct malted taste! No matter which candies you fill the gumball machine with, your mother is sure to love you every time she twists the cap and candies fall into her hand.</span></p>
<h3><b>Perfect for the Breakfast in Bed Lover</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have the tradition of surprising your mother in bed with a delicious breakfast? For some moms, sleeping in and getting to wake up to the smell of crispy bacon and freshly cooked waffles can be a real treat. Want to know how to make breakfast in bed even better this year? The secret is all in the toppings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your momma loves her chocolate, why not try adding a dollop of</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/snacks/products/cadbury-milk-chocolate-spread-uk"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cadbury Milk Chocolate Spread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the top of her pancakes! This smooth spread will add the perfect amount of chocolatey goodness to this breakfast classic. Pair this chocolate spread with some sliced strawberries and it’s sure to be the best breakfast ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also spice up your plain waffles or pancakes with some interesting toppings. Try sprinkling on a handful of</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/reese-s-pieces-1"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reese’s Pieces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the brand new</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/dippin-dots-popping-candy-with-candy-coating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dippin’ Dots Popping Candy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tastes just like frozen ice cream. You could even try mixing in</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/fudge-brownie-cookie-dough-bites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fudge Brownie Cookie Dough Bites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/chocolate-chip-cookie-dough-bites"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Bites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the batter! Our mouths are watering just thinking about it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember: not all superheros wear capes and your mom is definitely a hero to celebrate. Candy Funhouse has the best selection of sweets and treats for Mother’s Day so don’t delay when it comes to getting the best gift for your momma! Let us know on our</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CandyFunhouse.ca"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/candyfunhouse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://twitter.com/candyfunhouseca"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what your mom thought of her sweet treats.

When you want to order candy online, Candy Funhouse has you covered—and then some!<br> <br>We aren’t your ordinary, average candy store. We are creative minds who collaborate in the sweet name of candy! We are candy experts (no, really—we are) and our goal is make everyone’s life a little bit sweeter.<br> <br>You know that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you meet someone special? That moment in a romcom when boy meets girl, everything slows down, sparks fly, and the music begins to swell? Well, that’s how we feel about candy.<br> <br>And because we’re so passionate about candy and treats and confection sweets, we created Candy Funhouse.</p>
<h4>We put a whole new twist on candy culture.</h4>
<p>When someone thinks of candy, or when they are given candy as a gift, they usually light up like a Christmas tree. Surprise, joy, wonder, and just a little bit of “I’m-going-to-eat-it-all-right-now” excitement flicker across the faces of our customers. <em>THAT’S</em> what we’re all about. We want to add a “touch of sweetness” to your life; for your family, your friends, your special someone, or anyone else who deserves a little extra love in the form of sugary, delicious treats.<br> <br>One of the reasons why our customers love Candy Funhouse so much is because we bring this kind of positive, upbeat attitude into every aspect of our business. From our customer service to our party room (aka the Dreamatorium), we aim to bring a smile to your face to make sweet times happen naturally and easily. It’s that simple! We don’t just think outside the box, we live outside the box.<br><strong></strong></p>
<h4>Our service and selection are unparalleled.</h4>

Our fast and speedy shipping and service make us the perfect choice for getting quality, fresh candy quickly.

YUM.<br><br>Plus, we have more candies and fun surprises than even Willy Wonka did at his factory. No matter what kind of candy is your favourite, we really do have it all.<br><br>From your favourite homegrown Canadian chocolates, to that new British candy bar you just discovered, to classic American treats, we have it. All those candies you remember back from the 70s and 80s that you just don’t see in stores anymore? We got ‘em. That hard-to-find sour candy? Check! That particular flavour that’s your absolute favourite? No problem! That fudge that you just can’t get enough of? Yes, we have that too!

<h2><span>Our Favourite Back to School Candy</span></h2>
<p><span>Stacks of lined paper, and bright yellow pencils, brand new shoes and </span><span>backpacks... Back to desks and dusty chalkboards, and more than likely, </span><span>some whining kids that are not that eager for school to begin!</span></p>
<p><span>Help to ease those end-of-summertime blues, and send them back to school </span><span>smiling!  We've got some great candy for those little sweeties that </span><span>just might give them the extra encouragement they need for the back to </span><span>school season. </span></p>
<p><span>Here are some of <strong>Candy Funhouse's</strong> favourite back to school must have candies:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113031817/https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/smarties" target="_blank" title="Smarties Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smarties Candy</a>

<p>Did you know that Smarties originally came with letters on them in order to help kids learn the alphabet? Smarties are always a hit! Young and old alike, perfect for sharing with classmates or becoming the teacher's pet! A Retro Candy that you probably ate as a kid, these brightly-coloured chocolate candies have been around since the 1970s. Whether you "suck them very slowly or crunch them very fast ", Smarties are a back to school staple!</p>
<h3>
<br>2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113031817/https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skool-bus" target="_blank" title="Kidsmania Skool Bus filled with Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kidsmania Skool Bus filled with Candy</a>

<p>School trips will never be the same, send them off with this cute yellow "skool" bus that's jam-packed with delicious brightly-coloured candy! Not only is this candy fun to eat, but the yellow school bus also doubles as a toy! Makes the perfect lunch bag treat and a quiet bus ride!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113031817/https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/nerds-lemonade-wild-cherry-apple-watermelon" target="_blank" title="Nerds Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nerds Candy</a>

<p>We know it's cool to be a nerd, so why not eat them? Tiny, crunchy tangy bits of sugary fruity goodness. Nerds Candy may be small but pack big flavour! Nerds are a Retro Candy that we've been crunching since 1983. Nerds come in a wide variety of flavours, each pack contains a separate flavour compartment so you don't have all the pressure of picking a favourite. After all, being a Nerd is hard enough!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113031817/https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/razzles" target="_blank" title="Razzles" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razzles</a>

<p>"First it's a candy, then it's a gum" – Razzles are truly transformational! Starting off as a delicious candy and then turning into an even tastier gum, Razzles are two treats in one package! Razzles has been around since the 1960s. That's what at Candy Funhouse we like to call an "Old School Candy"!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>5. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113031817/https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/airheads-taffy-blue-raspberry" target="_blank" title="Airheads Taffy Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airheads Taffy Candy</a>

<p>A tangy, chewy, tasty taffy that's filled with the most intense fruity flavours, Airheads also come in a mystery flavour so you can always keep them guessing! Airheads are always a hit with the kids and the perfect size for a little back to school recess treat.</p>
<p>We've been sinking our teeth into this taffy since the early 1980s! Airheads Taffy Candy are a classic Retro Candy that we still love to eat. We don't want you to be an "Air Head", just eat them!</p>
<h3>

<p>Jelly Beans that double as a game! These aren't your Grandma's jelly beans! Beanboozled jelly beans are a mix of some good and also some crazy and gross flavours! Ever tasted rotten egg, mouldy cheese, canned dog food and even pencil shavings flavour? They come in a box with a spinner that helps you decide which ones you'll eat. The Beanboozled Challenge is a fun and daring game if you can stomach it, but of course, the gross factor seems to pull the kids in. Get your camera ready, as you will see their sweet little faces cringe in delight!</p>

<p>Going back to school would not be any fun without a big wad of bubble gum to chew on. What would you stick under your desk? Bazooka Bubblegum still comes with its famous Bazooka Joe comic strip on the inside of every wrapper. You'll always have some new jokes to tell your friends! This gum makes some super huge bubbles... and we've been blowing them with this Retro Bubble Gum since 1947!</p>
