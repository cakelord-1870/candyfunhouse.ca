      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we are <strong>BIG on LOVE!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></strong>Although Valentine’s Day is February 14th, we like to think we can celebrate love and kindness all year round – especially this coming year! </p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons why we celebrate Valentine’s Day – it’s tradition, it’s history, it’s exciting, it’s a whole month of celebrating those you love!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_2.57.55_PM_480x480.png?v=1607371102" alt="" width="516" height="345"></p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to limit your Valentine’s Day celebrations to just a ‘special someone’. Many people may not have a significant other, they may choose to live the single lifestyle – and we think that is just swell as long as that’s what makes you happy!</p>
<p class="p1">You can order some candy online from Candy Funhouse, just because it’s the BEST way to get it: By mail! Imagine looking in your mailbox and seeing that your online candy order has arrived? Woo-hoo!</p>
<p class="p1">These past few months have been a challenge for all of us, plus it’s Winter so it’s not always to visit family and friends. Let them know you are thinking about them and order some candy, treats, and chocolates online now so they get it way before Valentine’s Day arrives! Beat the rush, surprise them NOW!</p>
<h2 class="p1">Retro online candy for your parents:</h2>
<p class="p1">Candy Funhouse’s extensive collection of vintage and nostalgic (retro!) candy will remind them of their youth, of what their parents would bring home for them, of times past… And this is always a nice feeling, right?

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to chocolate, our love knows no bounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucky for us, in the month of March, there is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">full week</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dedicated to celebrating the delicious goodness of chocolate! Yep, you heard it here first—</span><b>the third week of March is American Chocolate Week!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the best time to break out some of your favourite American chocolate bars and enjoy them to the fullest, guilt-free (though we can’t say “guilt” and “chocolate” are two words we ever associate with one another!).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our crazy neighbors to the south have some chocolate bars that are pretty high-ranking when it comes to flavour, texture, and ingenuity, but we want to know what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think. Our candy connoisseurs here at Candy Funhouse got down to business and put together a list our favourite American chocolate bars. Get out that mini American flag and wave it around as we take you through our top ten picks of the most scrumptious American chocolate bars!</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/american-chocolate-bars/products/butterfinger-candy-bar"> Butterfinger</a></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think of when you think about Butterfinger? A night at the movies? The commercials from the ‘80s and ‘90s featuring the Simpsons? Or maybe you just think about its crispy, crunchy, peanut-buttery center, covered in ooey gooey milk chocolate goodness. Whatever you think about, it’s no denying that this American candy bar is a true classic. Plus, Butterfinger has such a long-standing history, so it’s no big mystery as to why it has gained such a following.</span></p>
<p><b>Bonus Fact:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s believed that Butterfinger bars were originally invented by Chicago’s Curtiss Candy Company back in 1923.</span></p>

This delicious bar is made of rich milk chocolate, creamy caramel, and smooth nougat. Seriously, every bite is a dream. Like Butterfinger, this bar was introduced in 1923, but by Frank C. Mars. It has been an American confectionary staple ever since.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a step back into the past with 100 Grand. 100 Grand bars debuted in the ‘60s and have been rewarding people with a rich snacking experience ever since with their crunchy chocolate and abundance of soft, chewy caramel. This chocolate bar always has us asking, “what would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do with 100 Grand?” (Us? ...More chocolate.)</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/american-chocolate-bars/products/3-musketeers-bar"> 3 Musketeers</a></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This old fashioned chocolate bar will definitely bring back some sweet memories. Brought to you by Mars Inc., this bar features a delicious, fluffy, whipped chocolate filling, enrobed in milk</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">chocolate. Some candy lovers say the 3 Musketeers bar is similar to Milky Way, but trust us when we say the 3 Musketeers has a special taste and texture all its own. Don’t believe us? Order one (or a few) of each and see for yourself!</span></p>
<p><b>Bonus Fact: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 3 Musketeers bar originally contained three miniature bars with filling flavours of vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate, creating the assembly of the "3 Musketeers". During the Great Depression, the company had to choose the best flavour to preserve, and you guessed it, it was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">chocolate</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/american-chocolate-bars/products/baby-ruth-bar"> Baby Ruth</a></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Baby Ruth bar is an American favourite that is made of peanuts, caramel, and chocolate-flavoured nougat, all covered in milk chocolate. It’s an experience of chocolatey goodness that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be tried!</span></p>
<p><b>Bonus Fact:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A common misconception about Baby Ruth chocolate bars is that they are named after the baseball pitcher Babe Ruth. In reality, Baby Ruth bars were named after President Cleveland's daughter, Ruth.</span></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/hersheys-krackel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Krackel</a></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hershey brought a whole new level of sweet chocolate goodness to the candy game when they created their Krackel chocolate bars. What’s the “krack” in “krackel” you might ask? Well, it’s nothing other than crunchy, crisped rice! We don’t know who it was that first thought of adding rice to a chocolate bar (we’ll need to get our research team on that), but it was certainly a genius move! This unique crunchy texture combined with the bar’s creamy milk chocolate has made Krackel a favourite treat for many for over 75 years.</span></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/american-chocolate-bars/products/reese-peanut-butter-cups"> Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups</a></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, okay, we concede that Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups do not technically fit the standard definition of a chocolate bar (they are after all, cup-shaped, not bar-shaped), but hear us out: This chocolate treat is just too well-loved and too classic to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include on this list!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contained in their iconic orange and yellow wrapper, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are the perfect marriage of chocolate and peanut butter. They were originally created in 1928, and still reign as one of the top chocolate candies today. Nothing goes together better than creamy milk chocolate and and the peanut butter found within one of these cups—except for maybe Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and your refrigerator… yup, they are even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delicious when chilled!</span></p>

<p>First introduced into the Canadian market in the 1960s by Cadbury Canada, the Cadbury Crunchie is a Canadian iconic candy bar ever since, with its unique recipe that is found nowhere else but in Canada. <strong><a href="https://www.canadianliving.com/food/article/makes-best-dairy-milk-chocolate-bar">Did you know that Cadbury Chocolate is made locally in Toronto?</a></strong> The Cadbury Crunchie Bar started in late 1929 in the U.K. by J S. Fry &amp; Sons. Cadbury Crunchie composes of honeycomb sponge toffee, which is produced in large slabs and then covered in the delicious milk chocolate we love. It is a classic Canadian chocolate bar that is loved by millions.</p>

<p>Cherry Blossom is one of the oldest candy bars in Canada. Originally made by the Walter M. Lowney Company, as they started manufacturing it in the 1890s. Now Hershey Canada keeps this old-fashioned candy tradition going. A nostalgic candy, it consists of a maraschino cherry and cherry syrup surrounded by chocolate, shredded coconut, and roasted peanuts. Cherry Blossoms come wrapped in tin foil within a nostalgic cardboard box. A sweet blast from the past!</p>

<p>As the name suggests, My Big is a BIG candy bar; it's the biggest candy bar produced by Cadbury in Canada (around 8 inches in length). Although very common in Canada, Mr. Big is also available in Hungary, Poland, and some areas of the United States. It's filled with vanilla wafer coated in caramel and rice crisp and coated in delicious Cadbury chocolate. Mr. Big is the only Cadbury candy bar to have an ice cream variant made by Nestle.</p>

The candy bar is a slab of decadent butter toffee, which is covered in a delicious milk chocolate coating. It is very similar to the Daim bar, which is a Swedish candy bar made with crunchy almonds. Of course, the Canadian version must be better, right? YES!!</span></p>

<p>The Lowney company deserves all the credit for starting Eat-more Candy Bars. Hershey Canada acquired them on July 1, 1987. Angus B. MacDonald named Eat-More in the early 1930s. The bar is chewy and stretches when you eat it. It consists of dark toffee, peanuts, and creamy chocolate. A caramel version came to market in 1995, which replaced the dark toffee with caramel, but sadly it has since been discontinued. The Eat-More candy bar is beyond satisfying and an awesome retro snack.</p>

<p>Crispy Crunch is a delicious chocolate bar with a crispy peanut flake centre. The history of Crispy Crunch has an exciting story: Do you know who invented Crispy Crunch and how? Harold Osin, a candy roller with the William Neilson company, developed this delightful Canadian chocolate bar in 1930. Interestingly, Neilson submitted the concept for crispy crunch in a chocolate bar content. Neilson won and received a $5.00 prize. The original recipe was a log-shaped bar, not like the crispy crunch we know and love today. The original manufacturer, Neilson, sold the brand to Cadbury in 1996, and the sweet story continues to this day. Crispy Crunch is a Canadian chocolate classic.</p>
