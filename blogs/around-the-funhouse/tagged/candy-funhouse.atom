      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Did you know that certain candies, snacks, and treats can actually help fight stress? Candy Funhouse has just the thing for that! </strong></p>
<p class="p1">This time of year can sure be stressful, and on top of it all, it has been a challenging year for many of us! Let’s get through it and see how the next candies to order online should include those that fight stress.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Chewing gum to fight stress</h2>
<p class="p1">The act of chewing gum has been shown to send those “satisfying” signals to our stress-suffering brains, much like eating food does. When you chew gum and on top of that combine it with that sweet or minty flavour, you’re actually sending calming vibes to your brain, dude! They’re called ‘endorphins’, and they make us happy… so go ahead and order some awesome chewing gum online and chew on!</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Here are a whole bunch of some of our favourite [<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results?type=product&amp;amp;q=gum*" target="_blank" title="gum" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUM</a>] treats:</strong></p>

<h2 class="p1">Shockingly sour candies to fight stress:</h2>
<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we love sour candies so much we even wrote a whole [<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/pucker-up-our-top-10-sourest-candy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>BLOG</strong></a>] about the most sour, favourite ones! Did you know that when you’re feeling stressed out one of the best things you can do is shock your tastebuds into flavourtown? That cheek-squeezing, tart reaction you have from sucking on a super sour candy automatically distracts your brain from the thing that is causing you stress, creating calming feelings… it’s true!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Some of Candy Funhouse’s most memorable [<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/sour-candy" target="_blank" title="sour candy lineup" rel="noopener noreferrer">sour candies</a>] to shock you into happiness include these favourites:</strong></p>

<h2 class="p1">Crunch it out!</h2>
<p class="p1">Snacking makes a brain happy. Some people snack because they’re bored, others snack out of stress. All you need to do is order a variety of different snacks and mix them all up into one big bowl! You’ll be feeling comforted right away… but please snack responsibly!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you think about these awesome crunchable snacks?</strong> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results?type=product&amp;amp;q=snacks*" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>[One click]</strong></a> and they’ll be on your online candy purchase basket!

<h2 class="p1">Chocolate is KING!</h2>
<p class="p1">Our Candy Funhouse team thinks this was a fitting title, since the first thing many of us reach out for when feeling anxious or sad, or even stressed out, is chocolate. You may have heard that chocolate is linked to our bodies producing “serotonins” right? Those are the neurotransmitters that make us feel happy. So pick your favourite choco-treats and order your chocolate lineup online straight away!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we are <strong>BIG on LOVE!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></strong>Although Valentine’s Day is February 14th, we like to think we can celebrate love and kindness all year round – especially this coming year! </p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons why we celebrate Valentine’s Day – it’s tradition, it’s history, it’s exciting, it’s a whole month of celebrating those you love!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_2.57.55_PM_480x480.png?v=1607371102" alt="" width="516" height="345"></p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to limit your Valentine’s Day celebrations to just a ‘special someone’. Many people may not have a significant other, they may choose to live the single lifestyle – and we think that is just swell as long as that’s what makes you happy!</p>
<p class="p1">You can order some candy online from Candy Funhouse, just because it’s the BEST way to get it: By mail! Imagine looking in your mailbox and seeing that your online candy order has arrived? Woo-hoo!</p>
<p class="p1">These past few months have been a challenge for all of us, plus it’s Winter so it’s not always to visit family and friends. Let them know you are thinking about them and order some candy, treats, and chocolates online now so they get it way before Valentine’s Day arrives! Beat the rush, surprise them NOW!</p>
<h2 class="p1">Retro online candy for your parents:</h2>
<p class="p1">Candy Funhouse’s extensive collection of vintage and nostalgic (retro!) candy will remind them of their youth, of what their parents would bring home for them, of times past… And this is always a nice feeling, right? Here are some ideas for those aged 45+ that you’d want to surprise for Valentine’s Day, including</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s that time of year, and what a year it has been! At Candy Funhouse we’re all about making those around you happy – and what better way than celebrating Christmas with candy!</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you started your Christmas shopping early at your local retailers, or if you finished ordering your gifts online, Christmas is never quite complete without the traditional stocking stuffers.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.05_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256722" alt="" width="531" height="355"></p>
<p class="p1">Christmas stockings have been around for centuries, and they’re the “bonus” that many kids – and adults! – look for on Christmas morning. Customs vary from country to country, for example, in many Asian countries it is still customary to give your friends and loved ones apples, which have been lovingly and creatively decorated and wrapped in pretty, colourful paper. Love that! And in Mexico, the Christmas piñata is still practised, with toys and candies abound.</p>
<p class="p1">We still prefer the stocking, and filling it can seem like a challenge… Until you check out Candy Funhouse’s Best Stocking Stuffer ideas for Christmas! Here are the top 12 ideas for what to put in your stockings this year:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">1. Cosmetics</h3>
<p class="p1">Not just for teens, but for moms and dads too! A specialty shaving kit for dad, a fancy night cream for mom, a new special sparkly nail polish for sis, and how about a fun little soap set for the toddler?</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Socks, of course!</h3>
<p class="p1">A stocking wouldn’t be quite the same without some new fun socks! Wrap them separately and make them UNmatchable… Because, who says socks have to match? Give each one of your kids a sock that doesn’t match, and let them figure it out!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.52_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256776" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Favourite fruit</h3>
<p class="p1">Add their favourite fruit – like a mango, a passion fruit, kiwi, or something different from abroad they may never have tried, like a lychee fruit, a pomegranate, or a star fruit. It’ll make for fun conversation too! Fruit has been stuffed into a Christmas stocking for AGES, why stop now?</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Jewelry</h3>
<p class="p1">It doesn’t have to be fancy, but even the smallest token of jewelry makes everyone smile! Like a button pin, different kind of earrings they’d never buy for themselves, cufflinks for the guys, or a cute little pendant.</p>
<h3 class="p1">5. Hair stuff</h3>
<p class="p1">We all need these, and we all run out of these – especially if you like doing ‘stuff’ with your hair! How about a new hairbrush, clips, and new fancy hair elastics?</p>
<h3 class="p1">6. Cards</h3>
<p class="p1">That’s “playing cards” for you! There are tons that are even sold at the local dollar store with different pictures on them, from Barbie to My Little Pony, Star Wars to the all-popular Yoda.</p>
<h3 class="p1">7. Eco items</h3>
<p class="p1">With the eco-craze going on right now, and since we’re all trying to avoid plastics, how about adding some paper straws to your stockings? There’s also traveling cutlery sets, and reusable collapsible cups. Help out Mother Earth this Christmas too!</p>
<h3 class="p1">8. Pet items</h3>
<p class="p1">They probably won’t get their own stocking, so why not add one item per stocking for each of the family members? This way, they can give it to Spot or Fluffy themselves: Like a specialty dog biscuit, a dog brush, or a new cat toy.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.26.36_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256823" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">9. Toothbrush</h3>
<p class="p1">This one deserves its own mention, as we really should be changing our toothbrush more often folks! Christmas time is the perfect time to invest in a new toothbrush for each family member. Goodbye germs, hello sparkly teeth!</p>
<h3 class="p1">10. A new subscription</h3>
<p class="p1">There are so many great magazines being published out there, and something for everyone! Get them a copy of it, roll it up, and subscribe them to the latest online edition! We all need less time on our iPhones, and more time off to unplug. Plus, a subscription is the gift that keeps on giving year 'round!</p>
<h3 class="p2">11. Handmade IOUs</h3>
<p class="p2">This is one of our favourites, because it’s made by YOU! Create a little set of “IOUs” that they can redeem on a once-per-month basis: Redeem for a kitchen chore, a bathroom cleanup, raking the garden, or even for a kiss! The possibilities are endless, and these IOUs can make for the best gifts of all. Get creative! You know what they’ll love! Whether working IOUs, romantic IOUs, funny IOUs, they're such a lovely gift to receive (and fun to make!).</p>
<h3 class="p1">12. Candy: OUR FAVOURITE!</h3>
<p class="p1">Of course we had to make this our BEST Christmas stocking stuffer idea of all time! Here are some of our favourites for this year:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/christmas-candy/products/pez-star-wars-mandalorian-twin-pack-gift-set-49-3g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEZ Star Wars Mandalorian Twin Pack Gift Set</a></h3>
<p class="p1">They’ll go crazy over it this year! It’s hot, it’s IN, and it’s SWEET!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_4.58.43_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256606" alt="" width="333" height="311"></p>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/christmas-candy/products/coal-mine-gum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coal Mine Gum Bag</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Bring back the laughter with a blast from the past! These retro bubble gums are juicy, flavourful, and so fun!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_4.52.24_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256539" alt="" width="305" height="342"></p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>If there is such a thing as a best time of year for candy, it’s Halloween!</strong> We all have great memories about trick or treating, and especially about going home and dumping the stash we collected on the table to sort out... and start devouring!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/halloween_candy_online_7b3bcded-cae5-4899-94bd-c1497625eff6.png?v=1599852410" alt="" width="518" height="339"></p>
<p class="p1">Some of us remember sorting out candy by name, by colour, or by type – chocolates together, lollipops in one pile, and gum in another. And do you remember making it a competition with your siblings to see who got the most candy? Our team at Candy Funhouse sure does!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong></strong>It’s no secret: Kids love candy, and if you’re having a candy buffet party or it’s their birthday and you want to celebrate by ordering some specialty candy online, it’s sometimes difficult to know what is best to get for them!</p>
<p class="p2">We especially worry about those kiddos with allergies! Of course, every small child should be monitored constantly to make sure they’re putting the safest goodies in their mouths, and candies are no exception. We got you parents!! And we’re sharing our safest candies for kids with you, so you can have some peace of mind! </p>
<p class="p2"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.25.08_PM_medium.png?v=1594754730" alt="girl candy" width="427" height="325" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Allergens in candies</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There are some candies that pose a threat to children with allergies, as they may contain the recognized “top 8 allergens”. Those allergens can include milk, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat or gluten in general, soybean, fish, shellfish and eggs. These food allergens must legally be clearly declared on any candy label, as they account for 90% of all food allergens.</p>
<p class="p1">The safest candies that have no allergens include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-original-candies-61-5g" target="_blank" title="skittles" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles</strong></a> – These flavours are safe from the top 8 allergens: Original, sour, wild berry, tropical, orchards, and Desserts flavours.<br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.27.23_PM_medium.png?v=1594754863" alt="">
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/sour-patch-kids-strawberry-candies-10-oz" target="_blank" title="sour patch kids strawberry" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sour Patch Kids</strong></a> – No top 8 allergens here either! This includes the lime, lemon, orange, berry and raspberry flavours. Hurray!<br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.27.14_PM_medium.png?v=1594754888" alt="">
</li>

<p class="p1"><strong>Vegan and vegetarian safe candies:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It’s no secret that vegans and vegetarians love to eat as much as the next person, and candies are no exception!</p>
<p class="p2">There are some candies which aren’t suitable for vegans as they may be made using ingredients such as gelatin, carmine, lard, confectioners glaze, bone char, milk, eggs, or honey. The following are amazingly enjoyable candies which you CAN have, if you’re vegan or vegetarian, as they do not contain any of these top 8 allergens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airheads Taffy</li>
<li>Dots</li>
<li>Dum Dums</li>
<li>Ferrara Atomic FireBalls</li>
<li>Ferrara Chocolate Wafer Swirls</li>
<li>Cry Baby Candy</li>
<li>Fruit by the Foot</li>
<li>Haribo Sour S’ghetti Gummi Candy</li>
<li>Hubba Bubba Gum</li>
<li>Jolly Rancher Lollipops</li>
<li>Joyva Chocolate Covered Orange and also Raspberry Ring Jells</li>
<li>Jujubes</li>
<li>Jujyfruits</li>
<li>Lemonheads</li>

<li>Zots</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><strong>Safest candies for small children:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Although enjoying candies on a regular basis is probably not the best thing for small toddlers, if they are over 2 years old you can give them the occasional treat – as long as it’s kid-safe, allergen-free, and not a choking hazard! Never give your small child any hard candies, at least until they turn 4 years old – and even then, monitor them while they’re tasting it, and learning how to eat it! So basically that means, sitting down to eat it… not ever running around with candy in their mouths!</p>
<p class="p1">Also unsafe for little ones are things like candy corn, pumpkin or sesame seeds, and gummy candy, taffy and caramel, because they can easily slip down their throat, causing them to choke. </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>So what is safest?</strong> Soft candies are probably the safest you can occasionally give your toddler to enjoy. Goodies like cotton candy, milk chocolate bars, peanut butter cups, and chocolate-covered peppermint patties are pretty safe, as long as they’re pre-cut in tiny pieces, and you’re cleared for any allergic reactions to the top 8 allergens mentioned above, like peanuts/nuts, dairy, gluten, and eggs. <em><strong>Always let your kids taste it WITH YOU, never alone or unattended!</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">The relationship kids will develop with candy can be a sweet and rewarding one, and there is a candy for everyone’s tastes, and even cultures! Check out the extensive candy collections we have at Candy Funhouse, and start picking some of your children's favourites for their next party! Make theirs a memorable one –make it something they’ll remember fondly for years to come!</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candy is something that never goes out of style. Adding a Candy Funhouse buffet could serve as an excellent wedding favour for your guests! This creative and fun way to engage your guests may seem like a simple project, but there is a lot more to it than you may imagine. A candy buffet or a wedding sweet table can be a fabulous focal point if you pay attention to the details, such as:</span></b></p>
<h3><b>How much candy to buy?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Candy Funhouse, our experience shows us that the rule of thumb - where candy buffet is concerned - is to keep a pound of assorted candy per 2 – 3 guests. You may need more if your candy favour bag is of a larger size. If your wedding planning is on a tighter budget, make sure you keep small-sized favour bags or containers to discourage overloading. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also reverse-calculate the amount of candy as per the container size. Purchase the containers first, and then identify the correct amount that will fill out the display. Make sure you pair the type of candy with container size. You want to use less expensive candy to fill up larger jars and the elegant specialty truffles for the smaller ones.</span></p>
<h3><b>The best containers to use in a candy buffet</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to stay true to your wedding décor while making things fun with a candy buffet. You would want to choose the right jars to make the buffet a fabulous display. Vases, large mason jars, fish bowls, and oversized glasses can be used to hold all the candy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedding experts suggest using different sized jars of various shapes to make the display more eye-catching. Visit your local thrift store to get glass vases at super cheap rates! Clear containers are recommended, because you want your guests to see the type of candy inside. Plus, clear containers are better when it comes to the aesthetic presentation of a wedding sweet table. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of jars depends on the guest list. Generally, it’s recommended to keep 5 jars for every 50 guests. So, if you have 200 guests coming, you should bank on 20 jars. </span></p>
<h3><b>Choosing the right favour packaging</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favour packaging is a must when planning a candy buffet. You want your guests to fill out the items they want in a compact, easy to handle packages. Generally, paper treat sacks, jars, miniature pails, clear bags and more are used in weddings candy buffet. You need to keep the favour package close to the buffet and somewhere it is seen easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/CandyFunhouse_favour_package_medium.png?v=1593187248" alt="Candy Funhouse favour bag" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<h3><b>Tips to set up an amazing candy buffet for your wedding</b></h3>
<p><strong><em>Follow your wedding colour theme</em><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candies come in fantastic shapes, sizes, and colours. You can add a pretty splash to the buffet table by adding candies that coordinate effortlessly with the overall décor. Your goal should be to create a show-stopping décor element while including all the popular varieties. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Consider your budget</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may want to go over-the-top with personalized chocolates and truffles, but let’s face it, weddings can be expensive and you may have to cut corners in some areas. The good news is that you can set up a lavish candy buffet at minimal costs if your wedding planning is just right. For instance, purchase your candies after a major holiday, like Thanksgiving or Easter - even at Candy Funhouse we may have special deals then! </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Buying in bulk is good</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can check out the candies in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/bulk-candy-canada">bulk</a> we offer at Candy Funhouse.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can score impressive deals and discounts by purchasing in bulk! You may just be able to include the more expensive varieties this way. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Don’t forget to mix and match</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your candy buffet doesn’t necessarily have to be about candy. It can include other tasty treats as well, such as marshmallows, nuts, pretzels, cookies, and more. The sky's the limit where variety is concerned. In fact, it is recommended to be versatile and flexible with your candy buffet. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Tongs and scoops keep things hygienic</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t want your guests passing around germs by using their hands to scoop out the candy, right? Scoops and tongs can keep things safe and hygienic so people can retrieve candy out of magnetic vessels. Make sure you keep multiple tongs or scoops at hand so that several people can make their selection at the same time. You could keep a utensil for each jar or vessel to allow guests to pick up their favourite treats or perhaps a treat they have never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever gone to a party where they had a Candy Buffet? Share your thoughts with Candy Funhouse!</span></p>

<h2>40th Birthday Party Inspiration for Sports Fans</h2>

<div class="blog-contents" style="border: none;">
<p id="1b1bdb59-6e96-44de-811b-86ae4c4dd3a5"><strong>I am:</strong> The ultimate superfan. It can be football, baseball, basketball, soccer - I don’t care! I live for the thrill of the game and I spend most of my time watching, playing, and talking sports. Nothing makes me happier than being at the game, a tailgating party, or just binging on sports all weekend from the comfort of my lucky chair. </p>
<p id="c08c7d9e-93d4-48f3-b535-752be689a090"><strong>My priority: </strong>I want to cheer my favourite team, player, an athlete on! </p>
<p id="e2dc7ba1-d7d7-44b1-b337-b153c604fe86"><strong>I hate it when: </strong>Responsibilities get in the way of sports.</p>
<p>Jocks want one thing - sports, sports, and more sports. Give them what they want and don’t hold back! Make them feel like a star quarterback on their 40th by surrounding them with their biggest fans and catering to their every wish. </p>

<p id="aeed852c-4194-41e0-bcc1-7c1f146ea6a4"><strong>I am: </strong>A lifelong learner and true academic. I love to think deeply about the big questions in life. Nothing makes me happier than delving into subjects like science, philosophy, religion, my fellow man, and life itself - whether on my own or in lengthy discourses with my friends.</p>
<p id="19a1a6ec-cc0b-41aa-a816-a1df71022873"><strong>My priority:</strong> To ponder the mysteries of the universe.</p>

<p>A scholar's 40th birthday party should reflect this significant milestone in his lifelong quest for knowledge. Make sure he feels appreciated for his deep insights and supported in his latest search for answers, whatever it might be. This type enjoys intimate parties with educated friends.</p>

      <![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Is your favourite candy on the list?</h2>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">One of the best perks of being in the candy business is, of course, all the candy!!! At Candy Funhouse we've indulged in many delicious candies over the years. Most of us have a few favourites, some of us even keep a secret stash. Whether you indulge by yourself or share it with a friend, one thing that unites us all is our love of candy. It's more than just a sweet treat. Candy is part of our pop culture and many of our memories.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> Let the candy take you back, to adventurous bike rides with friends, and long summer days you thought you would never end. Be a kid again, or at least pretend you are!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">We've seen it all at Candy Funhouse, in fact, we've tasted it all! But there are some classic, memorable candies that we can't live without.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Here is our list of the Top 30 Candies of All Time:</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Remember when Mom used to say "don't play with your food"? She might have been wrong in this case. Nik-L-Nips are those tiny wax bottles you used to love to play with and then eat. I bet you still do! Nik-L-Nips are filled with sweet and fruity tasting syrup. Bite off the top of the bottle then drink the liquid and chew the bottle like gum. You'll be Poppin these bottles again! Nik-L-Nips have been around since the early 1900s and are still a favourite of today. Like the slogan says, "Bite 'em, drink 'em, chew 'em"... Just don't forget to try 'em!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>

<h4>2. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/necco-wafers-chocolate" target="_blank" title="Necco Wafer Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Necco Wafers Candy</strong></a>
</h4>
<div><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/necco-wafers-original-candy-top-30-candies-of-all-time-candy-funhouse.png?v=1526246102" alt="Necco Wafers Original Candy-Top 30 Candies of All Time"></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Some things never change. This is especially true of these classic candies, Necco Wafers. They've been around since 1847, and they still use the exact same recipe. Necco Wafers did try at one point in time to change the ingredients and flavours but this sparked outrage among all the Necco Wafer fans and they very quickly reverted back to the original flavours. Necco Wafers come in an assortment of flavours including Orange, Lime, Clove, Chocolate, Cinnamon, Licorice and Wintergreen. They also have a roll of just the chocolate flavour. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/necco-wafers-chocolate" target="_blank" title="Necco Wafers" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Necco Wafers</strong></a> are popular and favourite old fashioned candy since 1847... and at Candy Funhouse, we love them!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> </div>
<div></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Who doesn't love a Sugar Daddy? Sugar Daddy's have been around since 1925, and are the oldest caramel lollipop around. With their perfectly chewy and smooth caramel, how could you resist? A Sugar Daddy lollipop takes some time to eat. You can't rush eating these delicious milk caramel lollipops! So relax and indulge in the long-lasting caramel taste of the famous retro candy-Sugar Daddy!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div></div>
<h4>4.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/pop-rocks-candy" target="_blank" title="Pop Rocks Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pop Rocks Candy</strong></a>
</h4>
<div><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/pop-rocks-candy-top-30-candies-of-all-time-candy-funhouse.png?v=1526251130" alt="Pop Rocks Candy-Top 30 Candies of All Time"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Little bits of sweet candy that pop in your mouth. You can hear and taste this candy. Whether you're a fan or not, Pop Rocks are most certainly a memorable candy experience. Pop Rocks are a retro candy favourite and they pack quite a punch with their explosive, sweet and fizzy, fruity flavour. Pop Rocks are literally a blast from the past! We've been eating this retro candy since 1975, and it's still a classic today. Pop Rocks once caused quite a stir when the rumours of Mikey (from the Life Cereal commercial)  was said to have eaten a package of Pop Rocks and then drank a bottle of Coke along with them, making his stomach explode, then died. <em>This is just not true!</em> Mikey is alive and well to this day and is probably eating a pack of Pop Rocks right now (we've heard that watermelon is his favourite flavour). Take a stroll back in time and indulge in the "Pop"!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div></div>
<h4>5. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/nerds-candy" target="_blank" title="Nerds Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nerds Candy</strong></a>
</h4>
<div><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/nerds-candy-top-30-candies-of-all-time-candy-funhouse.png?v=1526256822" alt="Nerds Candy-Top 30 Candies of All Times"></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">They might be tiny, but they're oh so crunchy, tangy and delicious! A box of Nerds Candy comes with two separate compartments and two different flavours all in one small and colourful box. Nerds Candy is inspired by Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory. They are a magical tiny burst of explosive flavour, from very sweet, to extremely sour. Nerds Candy are especially good when you have a great big mouthful of them and then try to talk. You can even mix and match the flavours of the box, or just eat one side at a time. Nerds are a retro candy from the 1970s and are still so groovy!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> </div>
<div></div>
<h4>6.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jawbreaker-lollipops" target="_blank" title="Jawbreakers Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jawbreakers Candy</strong></a>

<div><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/jawbreakers-candy-top-30-candies-of-all-time-candy-funhouse.png?v=1526257124" alt="Jawbreakers Candy-Top 30 Candies of All Time"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">They just might be the hardest candy ever made! With all their layers and layers, and more layers of sweet and long-lasting flavour, you won't be able to talk for a while. Perfect for a long car ride with the kids! Jawbreakers Candy is sometimes referred to as "jaw busters' and for good reason. Chewing and crunching on them is almost impossible until you're near the end. Some jawbreakers are smaller in size, and some are gigantic! There are a few jawbreakers that come with gum inside, kind of a reward for getting to the middle. Jawbreakers have been aching our jaws since the very early 1900s. An old fashioned candy that's here to stay... And if you've never tried them, you must order them from Candy Funhouse!</div>
<div></div>
<h4>7.<strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/salt-water-taffy" target="_blank" title="Salt Water Taffy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salt Water Taff</a>y</strong>
</h4>
<div><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/salt-water-taffy-top-30-candies-of-all-time-candy-funhouse.png?v=1526257601" alt="Salt Water Taffy-Top 30 Candies of All Time"></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Salt Water Taffy is an old fashioned candy treat. It's been around since the 1880s and is still a popular candy today. Don't let this candy fool you. Contrary to its name there is no salt in Salt Water Taffy. I can assure you it's sweet and chewy, stretchy and gooey. Salt Water Taffy comes in a wide variety of different flavours and colours. From soft pastels to black, making it perfect to add to your next candy buffet. Young and old alike all love Salt Water Taffy!</div>

<div><strong></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">These candies are long-lasting, full of flavour, and so very bold and fruity! Jolly Ranchers are an old-fashioned candy making their sweet debut in 1949.These candies were named "Jolly Rancher"  to imply a hospitable, western company. They certainly are! A Jolly Rancher candy can make anyone smile! Jolly Ranchers Candy will tantalize your taste buds with their intense fruity flavours. They still come in their original fruit flavours and even have a new <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jolly-rancher-cinnamon-fire-hard-candy" target="_blank" title="Jolly Ranchers Fruit N Sour" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jolly Ranchers Fruit N Sour</strong></a> flavour mix! If your extra bold you'll want to taste <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jolly-rancher-cinnamon-fire-hard-candy" target="_blank" title="Jolly Ranchers Cinnamon Fire" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jolly Ranchers Cinnamon Fire</strong></a> flavour. </div>
<div></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Smarties are a classic Canadian candy that have been around since 1937! Smarties Candy is great for sharing, or not! With their array of bright and bold colourful shells, filled with creamy milk chocolate they are hard to resist. There's an American candy that also goes by the name "Smarties" but our Smarties far outweigh their version. We have the real ones and ours include chocolate. It makes us proud to be Canadian! By the way "do you suck them very slowly or crunch them very fast?</div>
<div></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">A quintessential candy combining the flavours of caramel and milk chocolate, how could you go wrong? Milk Duds are an old fashioned candy first coming out in 1926, we had no idea they have been around that long! These are round candies with a caramel nugget on the inside and completely covered in chocolate. Milk Duds are a popular treat at movie theatre concessions – no wonder, they make the perfect chaser after all that buttery popcorn.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> </div>

<div style="text-align: center;">A lollipop with bubblegum in the middle! Whoever came up with this idea was pure genius! Childhood is just not complete without indulging in these double whammy lollipops. Charms Blow Pop comes in so many flavours it's hard to just choose one! Some of their more modern flavours are Sour Apple, Black Ice, Blue Razz, What-A-Melon and Candy Corn. These retro lollipops are just hard to beat, first the delicious lollipop, then the chewy bubblegum! These were the very first gum filled lollipops in the world! They've been around since the early 1970s. Groovy Baby!</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">If you're bold and brave and looking for a hot but sweet treat, you'll love these Atomic Fireball Candy. Atomic Fireball came out in 1954, and to this day, 15 million are consumed every week, all around the world. They say that Atomic Fireball candies revolutionized the candy world by combining that hot and spicy cinnamon flavour into a candy.  If you're a fan of all things intense and hot, these retro candies are for you.

<div style="text-align: center;">"Unexplainably juicy" yes, the perfect description of a Starburst candy. These soft chewy, taffy morsels of goodness have been around since 1967. Starburst was once called "Opal Fruits" when it was first made in England, but upon it's arrival here to North America, the name was fittingly changed to Starburst. I can't imagine eating a candy called Opal Fruits, Starburst is where it's at. The name is so fitting for the exciting, intense burst of flavour in every bite. These are great for sharing, or trying to bribe someone. They come in a great little convenient package, just the right size for pockets too!</div>
<div></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">15 million are made a day! If you love the combination of mint and chocolate look no further. With their fresh minty center and dark chocolate coating, Junior Mints make for a refreshing sweet snack. Junior Mints were first introduced in 1949 and at Candy Funhouse, they remain one of the most popular old fashioned candies to this day!</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">You might not like tuna fish but these Swedish Fish are hard to resist! Always a go-to candy at the corner store, easy to stuff your brown paper bag with, even easier to eat. Swedish Fish Candy came out in the 1950s, and remain a retro candy favourite. Their sweet fruity flavour is sort of a mystery. Some say cherry, others say raspberry. Actually they say the flavour of Swedish fish is more of an exotic berry called lingonberry. Whatever the berry, we'll take them. This retro candy is a must-have for any age. Who knew that these retro fish were so exotic!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<strong>"Are you going my way?" You are if you love the Milky Way Candy Bar.</strong> </div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Chocolate malt nougat, topped with caramel and then covered with milk chocolate, this bar has everything required in a classic candy bar. A real oldie, coming out in 1923. The Milky Way Candy Bar definitely has staying power. So delicious and satisfying, the old fashion candy Milky Way bar is definitely out of this world!</div>
<div></div>
<h4>17.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-original-candies-61-5g" target="_blank" title="Skittles Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles Candy</strong></a>

<div><strong></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">A  brilliant, sweet rainbow of flavours! Skittles Candy is a must-have. Every morsel of this chewy, mouth-watering candy is not only bright and colourful but is matched with an intense fruity taste that is second to none. Skittles Candy gave us their most delicious rainbow of flavours in 1979. Now there are many more besides the originals. These include <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-sour-candies-56-7-g" target="_blank" title="Skittles Sour" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles Sour</strong></a>, Skittles Brightside, Skittles Wildberry, and even Skittles Sweet Heat. Time to make up for a childhood with only the Skittles Original. What about you, which one will you try next?</div>
<div></div>
<h4>18.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/giant-tootsie-roll-3oz" target="_blank" title="Tootsie Roll Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tootsie Roll Candy</strong></a>
</h4>

<div style="text-align: center;">Tootsie Roll Candy is an old fashion candy, a nostalgic taste of days gone by. In a class by themselves, as I've never come across another candy quite like a Tootsie Roll. Not a caramel, and not a taffy either, but a chewy bite of a yummy chocolate tasting candy. These were the very first penny candy ever sold. These old fashioned candies were even given to soldiers as part of their ration.  I make it a rule to never ration my intake of Tootsie Rolls! We've been unwrapping these sweet treats since 1907!</div>
<div></div>
<h4>19.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/candy-corn" target="_blank" title="Candy Corn" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Candy Corn</strong></a>

<div style="text-align: center;">You either love it or absolutely hate it. But Halloween or Thanksgiving would not be the same without the sweet edition of Candy Corn. But who needs an occasion for this sweet snack? This is a very old fashion candy. Candy Corn first came out in 1880 but was known as "Chicken feed" back then. I think the name change to Candy Corn sounds much more appealing. Candy Corn can be enjoyed at any time of the year, Halloween or not! We carry them in stock, so why not order them online? Just imagine the sweet delivery at your doorstep!</div>
<div></div>
<h4>20.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/reese-peanut-butter-cups" target="_blank" title="Reese's Peanut Butter Cups" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</strong></a>

<div style="text-align: center;">There's a reason that these are the number one selling candy brand in North America. Nothing in the whole world is quite as perfect as the combination of peanut butter and chocolate. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups also come in some new variations like white chocolate, crunchy, king size, and even dark chocolate. Reese's also makes Reese's Pieces another old fashion candy we love to indulge in. They now have Reese's Pieces filled peanut butter cups! The Reese's brand is truly iconic, coming out in 1928, and is recognized worldwide. </div>

<div style="text-align: center;">What is sweeter than a kiss? A Hershey's Kiss! This is the kiss we all crave, after all its chocolate! These sweet morsels of Hershey's famous chocolate with their distinctive shape are still as popular as their debut in 1907. No one knows exactly why they're called "kisses". Some say it was because of the sound the machine made as they came out. It's a sweet name in any case. It's hard to just eat one, but at Candy Funhouse we have the Giant Hershey's Kiss because one kiss is just never enough!</div>
<div></div>
<h4>22.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/m-ms-chocolate" target="_blank" title="M&amp;M's Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M&amp;M's Candy</strong></a>

<div style="text-align: center;">M&amp;M's are an old fashioned candy favourite! They first came out in 1941, and are still as popular today as ever. M&amp;M's Candy is sold in over 100 countries and there are over 40 million individual M&amp;M's Chocolate Candies made every day. The original M&amp;M's Candy was bright candy-coated milk chocolate. The second introduction was M&amp;M's with peanuts. Now M&amp;M's Candy has extensively expanded its flavours. M&amp;M's Candy now comes in peanut butter, pretzel, dark chocolate, caramel, almond and even strawberry. Any and every one of M&amp;M's flavours is delicious. So go on, try them all, and let them "melt in your mouth, not in your hands".</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Life Savers came out in 1912. These old fashioned candies are a standby in the candy world.  I remember getting the Christmas edition of Life Savers every year, it always marked the occasion so perfectly. Life Savers originally only came in the Pep-O-MInt flavour. It wasn't until 1935 that Life Savers included the colourful rolls that I remember eating. These flavours consisted of lemon, lime, orange, cherry and pineapple. We can't forget the Butter Rum Life Savers. They are absolutely delicious. Life Savers even come in a gummy form now. But nothing beats that hard candy with the hole in the middle, that quickly becomes so easy to crunch! After all, Life Savers are "a hole lot of fun!"</div>

Perfect for a snack and a laugh at your desk when the workday feels like it'll never end. It comes in Cherry, Grape, Watermelon, Strawberry and my favourite, Banana. There's also a new edition to Laffy Taffy, Guava Pineapple this is inspired by the tropical tastes of Mexico! Laffy Taffy is a staple retro candy to keep in your stash. It has been around since the 1970s and has become a classic retro candy. By the way, What has no legs but can do the splits? A banana! What's your favourite Laffy Taffy joke?</div>

With its torturous sour taste, your face will contort, and with those sour squinting eyes you'll think you can't possibly take anymore. But then surprise, these candies will magically transform into a sweet, fruity tasting candy. There's nothing quite like a Warhead, a must-have for the sour candy lover!

Cotton Candy was invented by a dentist of all people who just happened to be a lawyer too. It used to be called "Fairy Floss" and in some parts of the world, it still goes by that name.

<div style="text-align: center;">A candy that transforms into a gum. Razzles are awesome! It's like two candies in one! Razzles is a must-have retro candy. They first came out in 1966.

Razzles still come in their original great flavour, but they have since expanded into, Razzles Sour, Razzles Tropical, and also Razzles Fizzles. Do you remember the jingle? "First it's a candy and then it's a gum-Little round Razzles are so much fun!" </div>

That amounts to circling the globe 40 times! It's even a part of the famous boxer, Floyd Mayweather's pre-fight diet. Twizzlers licorice candy also has the ability to be used as a straw!

<p>Cherry Blossom is one of the oldest candy bars in Canada. Originally made by the Walter M. Lowney Company, as they started manufacturing it in the 1890s. Now Hershey Canada keeps this old-fashioned candy tradition going. A nostalgic candy, it consists of a maraschino cherry and cherry syrup surrounded by chocolate, shredded coconut, and roasted peanuts. Cherry Blossoms come wrapped in tin foil within a nostalgic cardboard box. A sweet blast from the past!</p>

Although very common in Canada, Mr. Big is also available in Hungary, Poland, and some areas of the United States. It's filled with vanilla wafer coated in caramel and rice crisp and coated in delicious Cadbury chocolate. Mr. Big is the only Cadbury candy bar to have an ice cream variant made by Nestle.</p>

<p>The Lowney company deserves all the credit for starting Eat-more Candy Bars. Hershey Canada acquired them on July 1, 1987. Angus B. MacDonald named Eat-More in the early 1930s. The bar is chewy and stretches when you eat it. It consists of dark toffee, peanuts, and creamy chocolate. A caramel version came to market in 1995, which replaced the dark toffee with caramel, but sadly it has since been discontinued. The Eat-More candy bar is beyond satisfying and an awesome retro snack.</p>

<p>Crispy Crunch is a delicious chocolate bar with a crispy peanut flake centre. The history of Crispy Crunch has an exciting story: Do you know who invented Crispy Crunch and how? Harold Osin, a candy roller with the William Neilson company, developed this delightful Canadian chocolate bar in 1930. Interestingly, Neilson submitted the concept for crispy crunch in a chocolate bar content. Neilson won and received a $5.00 prize. The original recipe was a log-shaped bar, not like the crispy crunch we know and love today. The original manufacturer, Neilson, sold the brand to Cadbury in 1996, and the sweet story continues to this day. Crispy Crunch is a Canadian chocolate classic.</p>

Where else could you find chocolate covered Turkish delight, purple gum that tastes like soap, and the real "Smarties"?  Canada gives "home sweet home" its true meaning.<br>Here is our top ten list of must-have Canadian Candies.<br><br>1. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/mackintoshs-mack-toffee" target="_blank" title="Mackintosh's Mack Toffee" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mackintosh's Mack Toffee</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/mackintoshs-mack-toffee-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse.jpg?v=1472388821" alt="Mackintosh's Mack Toffee Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p><br>Its history is long and delicious. Canadians have been indulging since 1890, making Mackintosh's Creamy Toffee one of our favourite Old Fashioned Canadian candy. Mackintosh's Toffee is made in a solid rectangular slab and the packaging is distinctive, with its cute tartan-like design. "Smack Your Mack" is the famous slogan for this toffee, as many people choose to break it up into smaller bite size pieces by breaking it up. Or you could be brave with your teeth and bite into it at your own risk! Whichever way you eat it, Mackintosh's Toffee is smooth and sweet, delicately salted and perfectly creamy!<br><br>2. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/eat-more-candy-bar" target="_blank" title="Eat-More" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eat-More</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/eat-more-retro-candy-bar-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse.jpg?v=1472389092" alt="Eat-More Retro Candy Bar Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p><br>Who does not want to be told to eat more? This candy bar is made of robust dark toffee, roasted peanuts and chocolate. It is an exemplary combination of a chewy and firm texture. Eat-More's are a retro bar that certainly hits the spot when you're hungry. Filling and satisfying, the Canadian Eat-More bar is one of a kind – you will not find a duplicate anywhere else except for in Canada! <br><br>3. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/big-turk" target="_blank" title="Big Turk" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Turk</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/big-turk-retro-candy-bar-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse.jpg?v=1472389407" alt="Big Turk Retro Candy Bar Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p>Big Turk Chocolate Bars are exclusive to Canada and certainly exclusive to certain taste buds!  Some say it is a required taste, but for sure Big Turk bars are unique and do offer big flavour! The middle of Big Turk bars are filled with a nice solid piece of "Turkish delight" – a specialty confection based on a gel of starch and sweet, sweet sugar. <br>A kind of gummy like textured candy, with a pretty sort of reddish-purple like hue, the outside is completely covered in a nice thick layer of rippled milk chocolate. Some people say it reminds them of chocolate covered red licorice, but at Candy Funhouse we disagree! The inside reminds us more of an Allan's BigFoot sort of taste. Big Turks are certainly distinctive, yet also luring for the calorie counting candy lovers, as these bars have 60% less fat than the average chocolate candy bar! Hurray for the sweet-lover's diet!<br><br>4.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/maynards-wine-gums" target="_blank" title="Maynards Wine Gum" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maynards Wine Gums</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/maynards-wine-gums-old-fashioned-nostalgic-candy-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse-ca.jpg?v=1472389853" alt="Maynards Wine Gums Old Fashioned and Nostalgic Candy Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p><br>An Old Fashioned candy that is very popular in Canada. Wine gums could be compared to gumdrops but without the sugary coating. Despite what the name implies, sorry to disappoint you, Maynards Wine Gums contain no wine! Although their flavour is meant to mock the taste of a fine red wine or a port. Once you've had a wine gum you will never forget their intense, smooth taste. They are not comparable to other gummy-like candies, they are chewy, but not sticky or stretchy. Maynards Wine Gums have been around since 1896. A very Old Fashioned Candy that deserves to be savoured.<br><br><br>5.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/aero-bar" target="_blank" title="Aero Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aero Bar</a></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/areo-bar-old-fashioned-nostalgic-candy-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse-ca.jpg?v=1472390191" alt="Areo Bar Old Fashioned and Nostalgic Chocolate Bar"></span></p>
<p>Bubbly, smooth, and melt in your mouth milk chocolate! A retro chocolate bar that Canadians have been eating since the 1970's. At some point in the 1980's it was introduced in the United States but it failed to deliver the "wow" factor that Canadians love about Aero Chocolate Bars. I guess they didn't appreciate the bubbles like we do! Aero Chocolate Bars are a pleasure to indulge in, one of the many perks of being Canadian, eh?<br><br>6.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/coffee-crisp" target="_blank" title="Coffee Crisp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Crisp</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/coffee-crisp-old-fashioned-nostalgic-candy-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse-ca.jpg?v=1472390493" alt="Coffee Crisp Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p><br>If they ask you here "how do you like your coffee?" we just might say CRISP! Coffee Crisp Chocolate Candy Bars are a part of our Canadian heritage. Canadians have been enjoying this "nice light snack" Chocolate Bar since 1939! With its light and crispy wafers sandwiching a coffee favoured type filling that alternates between thin layers of chocolate, then completely covered in milk chocolate. You just can't go wrong! So yes, as proud Canadians, we like our coffee "crisp"!<br><br>7.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/smarties-candy" target="_blank" title="Smarties" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smarties</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/smarties-old-fashioned-nostalgic-candy-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse-ca.jpg?v=1472390794" alt="Smarties Old Fashioned &amp; Nostalgic Candy"></p>
<p><br>Americans may think they have Smarties, but we know those are really called "Rockets" here in Canada. We have the real ones! And our Smarties include chocolate! Our Smarties are are the most vividly colourful candy coated bits of milk chocolate! They are a staple, found down every Canadian Candy aisle. Smarties are a Retro Canadian Candy and as any good Canadian would tell you, we do eat the red ones last!<br><br>8. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/thrills-gum" target="_blank" title="Thrills Gum." rel="noopener noreferrer">Thrills Gum</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/thrills-gum-old-fashioned-nostalgic-candy-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse-ca.jpg?v=1472391083" alt="Thrills Gum Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p>Thrills Gum were originally manufactured in London, Ontario by the O Pee Chee Company before being bought out by Nestles in the early 1980's. A beautiful purple gum that as strange as it may sound, is known for its sweet, soap-like flavour, Thrills Gum is sort of an odd required taste. You are either a fan or not, there is no middle of the road with this gum! It's the addition of rosewater in this gum that gives it such a unique and distinctive taste. Thrills gum even states on the package "it still tastes like soap" – A perfect choice for those of us with colourful language, and a great way to get your thrills!<br><br>9. <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/ganong-pal-o-mine" target="_blank" title="Pal O Mine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pal O Mine</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/pal-o-mine-old-fashioned-nostalgic-candy-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse-ca.jpg?v=1472391340" alt="Pal O Mine by Ganongn Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p>We must thank Arthur Ganong for this special Canadian Chocolate Bar.<br>He was the brainchild behind the making of the first actual wrapped chocolate bar, making him a pure Canadian genius! The <a href="https://ganong.com/our-sweet-story/" target="_blank" title="Ganong Candy Company" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ganong Candy Company</a> started in 1873, making it Canada's oldest candy company, located in St. Stephen's, New Brunswick. Pal-O-Mine is a delicious, old fashioned Canadian chocolate bar made of a rich fudge centre, then smothered in coconut, peanuts and Ganong's premium dark chocolate!<br>Ganong even has a <a href="http://www.chocolatemuseum.ca/" target="_blank" title="Chocolate Museum" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolate Museum </a>in St. Stephen's. This museum includes hands-on experiences and interactive displays. Visitors are also more than welcome to sample the chocolate! Sounds like a tasty visit!<br><br>10.<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/maltesers-canada" target="_blank" title="Maltesers" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maltesers</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/maltesers-old-fashioned-nostalgic-candy-top-10-canadian-candy-candyfunhouse-ca.jpg?v=1472391616" alt="Maltesers Top 10 Canadian Candy"></p>
<p><br>Maltesers are an Old Fashioned and Nostalgic Candy, dating all the way back to the 1930's! They are delicious balls consisting of a light, slightly crispy, malt honeycomb centre, surrounded with a healthy layer of rich milk chocolate! These could be compared to their almost-American twin, Whoppers. However, our Canadian Maltesers win every time! The balls are bigger and they do boast a much more generous coating of milk chocolate. Maltesers are proudly made by Mars Canada, and are an absolute must-have Canadian Retro Candy!<br><br>These are just a few delicious perks of being Canadian, but by all means, some of the sweetest! Check out the extensive <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/canadian-candy" target="_blank" title="Canadian Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Candy</a> and <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/canadian-chocolate-bars" target="_blank" title="Canadian Bars" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Bars</a> selection offered right here at Candy Funhouse... and order yourself some sweet treats to enjoy!

<p><strong>To indulge or not to indulge? That is the real question!</strong></p>
<div>Every once in a while we all have sweet cravings, especially chocolate cravings!</div>
<div>At Candy Funhouse, we decided to find the most reasonable healthy choices available at our specialty online candy store! Here are our top choices, when you're looking for that special sweet so'm so'm that will give you the satisfaction you're looking for, without all the guilt:</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/hersheys-special-dark-giant-bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hershey's Special Dark</a></strong></div>
<div>This sweet Special Dark goodness bar is sitting at just 195 calories, and 12.5 grams of fat... plus it offers all the benefits of dark chocolate! </div>
<div>Dark chocolate is not only a super tasty treat, but it also has the benefits of antioxidants and the minerals our body needs, minus the high amount of sugar milk chocolate may offer. Dark chocolate has been shown to help lower the risk of some health issues, like heart disease. Why not break off a little piece of Hershey's Special Dark? Or a big piece... we won't tell! </div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Hershey's" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004im_/http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/hersheysdark_large.jpg?7990045310450695791" style="float: none;"></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004/http://candyfunhouse.ca/products/100-grand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 Grand</a></strong></div>
<div>When's the last time you indulged in a delicious 100 Grand? A crispy creamy filling but not sky-high in calories or fat, it comes in at only 180 calories and 8 grams of fat! Plus it's super good!</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<img alt="100 Grand" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004im_/http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/100k_large.jpg?10190800726807471402" style="float: none;"><br><br>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004/http://candyfunhouse.ca/products/mounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mounds</a></strong></div>
<div>It's chocolatey, coconut filled, and relatively low in calories at just 195 calories</div>
<div>with 11 grams of fat! Because of the coconut filling, it also has 2 grams of protein... and tastes so much better than an energy bar! Wait... it actually IS an energy bar that will satisfy your cravings! </div>
<div><img alt="Mounds " src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004im_/http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/mounds_large.jpg?13554771075981750866" style="float: none;"></div>
<div><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004/http://candyfunhouse.ca/products/york-peppermint-patty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">York Peppermint Patties</a></strong></div>
<div>If you don't remember having grown up with a York Peppermint Patty, you haven't lived! They only have 140 calories and 2.5 grams of fat - and in the sweets world, that is very little fat for so much flavour! York Peppermint Patties are deliciously minty, and the portion is just perfect when you want something delicious but not overly huge. You're welcome!</div>
<div>
<br><img alt="York" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004im_/http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/york_large.jpg?2695706789517305588" style="float: none;">
</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004/http://candyfunhouse.ca/products/baby-ruth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Ruth</a></strong></div>
<div>The hunger strikes... the cravings are there... batter up with a Baby Ruth! It has 4 grams of protein, 280 calories, and just 14 grams of fat. Look at all the chocolatey goodness, plus peanuts to boot! At Candy Funhouse we just love our Baby Ruth!  Score!!!</div>
<div><img alt="Baby Ruth" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004im_/http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/babyruth_large.jpg?238060208823719300" style="float: none;"></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/payday" target="_blank" title="PayDay bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayDay</a></strong></div>
<div>Last but not least, one of our all-time favourites at Candy Funhouse, PayDay!</div>
<div>Although there's actually no chocolate in this one, it's a caramel log that is</div>
<div>coated in salted peanuts. This bar packs quite a punch at 240 calories and 13 grams of fat – but the best part of this delicious combo is the protein: Pay Day boasts a whole 7 grams of protein! That is amazing for your energy level, plus to satisfy your cravings in a healthy way... Go ahead, get a PayDay today!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Pay Day " src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212004im_/http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/payday_large.jpeg?2132753087042843455" style="float: none;"></div>
