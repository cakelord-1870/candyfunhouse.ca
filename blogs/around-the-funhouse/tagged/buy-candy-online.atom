<p>Times may have changed, but people have not. After working so hard we all need a vacation, even if that means a Staycation! Time off work, time to catch up on some Netflix, maybe dust off the winter blues and start thinking of springtime ahead... with candy by your side!</p>
<h2>Here are some ways to make March Break happen for the whole family:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Game night. Every night! </strong> Schedule a game night with your family, and make your games revolve around candy. Our Candy Funhouse team put together this candy game blog <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/bring-in-the-new-year-with-candy-games" target="_blank" title="candy games" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>[HERE]</strong></a> with lots of sweet ideas to tie in with. Everyone loves a good game night, schedule it in!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.52.51_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803197" alt="" width="388" height="303"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>March Break around the world.</strong> Pick a country or region and dress up with that theme... One country per day = 7 days of fun! Make your candy online purchase selection match the different countries you're picking. For example, on "Mexican Day" you can have a taco dinner night, then <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/doritos-3d-crunch-chili-cheese-nacho-326g" target="_blank" title="3d nacho chips" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Doritos 3D Crunch Chili Cheese Nacho Chips</strong></a> while watching a Mexican film, followed by <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/efrutti-mexican-dinner" target="_blank" title="efrutti Mexican" rel="noopener noreferrer">efrutti Mexican Dinner</a></strong> gummies!  Candy Funhouse has online candy sales from Japan, British candy, Australian candy, and of course our very own Canadian candy - and this is cause for celebration!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.46.33_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803087" alt="" width="221" height="220"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.45.26_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803112" alt=""><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Celebrate Spring.</strong> March 20th is the first day of spring, so why not celebrate it early and get the family going on springtime fun-time? You can get the smaller kiddoes planting some seeds and for every seed they plant they get a special treat! On another day, take the kids on a drive to look at some of the early blooms surrounding the neighbourhood, like daffodils, crocuses and tulips - then they can match the colours they see with a colourful candy! Here are some favourites, including Australia's <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/australian-candy/products/lifesaver-tingles-fruit-aus-34g-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lifesaver Fruit Tingles</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-tropical-candies-61-5-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles Tropical</strong></a> candies, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jelly-belly-kids-mix-3-5oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jelly Belly Kids Mix</strong></a>, or even <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bigs-cheese-burger-sunflower-seeds-152-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bigs Cheese Burger</strong></a> sunflower seeds, which they'll love!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.59.37_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803770" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.00.40_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803787" alt=""><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.04.42_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803901" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.01.41_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803806" alt=""><br><br>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we are <strong>BIG on LOVE!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></strong>Although Valentine’s Day is February 14th, we like to think we can celebrate love and kindness all year round – especially this coming year! </p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons why we celebrate Valentine’s Day – it’s tradition, it’s history, it’s exciting, it’s a whole month of celebrating those you love!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_2.57.55_PM_480x480.png?v=1607371102" alt="" width="516" height="345"></p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to limit your Valentine’s Day celebrations to just a ‘special someone’. Many people may not have a significant other, they may choose to live the single lifestyle – and we think that is just swell as long as that’s what makes you happy!</p>
<p class="p1">You can order some candy online from Candy Funhouse, just because it’s the BEST way to get it: By mail! Imagine looking in your mailbox and seeing that your online candy order has arrived? Woo-hoo!</p>
<p class="p1">These past few months have been a challenge for all of us, plus it’s Winter so it’s not always to visit family and friends. Let them know you are thinking about them and order some candy, treats, and chocolates online now so they get it way before Valentine’s Day arrives! Beat the rush, surprise them NOW!</p>
<h2 class="p1">Retro online candy for your parents:</h2>
<p class="p1">Candy Funhouse’s extensive collection of vintage and nostalgic (retro!) candy will remind them of their youth, of what their parents would bring home for them, of times past… And this is always a nice feeling, right? Here are some ideas for those aged 45+ that you’d want to surprise for Valentine’s Day, including</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s that time of year, and what a year it has been! At Candy Funhouse we’re all about making those around you happy – and what better way than celebrating Christmas with candy!</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you started your Christmas shopping early at your local retailers, or if you finished ordering your gifts online, Christmas is never quite complete without the traditional stocking stuffers.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.05_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256722" alt="" width="531" height="355"></p>
<p class="p1">Christmas stockings have been around for centuries, and they’re the “bonus” that many kids – and adults! – look for on Christmas morning. Customs vary from country to country, for example, in many Asian countries it is still customary to give your friends and loved ones apples, which have been lovingly and creatively decorated and wrapped in pretty, colourful paper. Love that! And in Mexico, the Christmas piñata is still practised, with toys and candies abound.</p>
<p class="p1">We still prefer the stocking, and filling it can seem like a challenge… Until you check out Candy Funhouse’s Best Stocking Stuffer ideas for Christmas! Here are the top 12 ideas for what to put in your stockings this year:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">1. Cosmetics</h3>
<p class="p1">Not just for teens, but for moms and dads too! A specialty shaving kit for dad, a fancy night cream for mom, a new special sparkly nail polish for sis, and how about a fun little soap set for the toddler?</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Socks, of course!</h3>
<p class="p1">A stocking wouldn’t be quite the same without some new fun socks! Wrap them separately and make them UNmatchable… Because, who says socks have to match? Give each one of your kids a sock that doesn’t match, and let them figure it out!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.52_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256776" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Favourite fruit</h3>
<p class="p1">Add their favourite fruit – like a mango, a passion fruit, kiwi, or something different from abroad they may never have tried, like a lychee fruit, a pomegranate, or a star fruit. It’ll make for fun conversation too! Fruit has been stuffed into a Christmas stocking for AGES, why stop now?</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Jewelry</h3>
<p class="p1">It doesn’t have to be fancy, but even the smallest token of jewelry makes everyone smile! Like a button pin, different kind of earrings they’d never buy for themselves, cufflinks for the guys, or a cute little pendant.</p>
<h3 class="p1">5. Hair stuff</h3>
<p class="p1">We all need these, and we all run out of these – especially if you like doing ‘stuff’ with your hair! How about a new hairbrush, clips, and new fancy hair elastics?</p>
<h3 class="p1">6. Cards</h3>
<p class="p1">That’s “playing cards” for you! There are tons that are even sold at the local dollar store with different pictures on them, from Barbie to My Little Pony, Star Wars to the all-popular Yoda.</p>
<h3 class="p1">7. Eco items</h3>
<p class="p1">With the eco-craze going on right now, and since we’re all trying to avoid plastics, how about adding some paper straws to your stockings? There’s also traveling cutlery sets, and reusable collapsible cups. Help out Mother Earth this Christmas too!</p>
<h3 class="p1">8. Pet items</h3>
<p class="p1">They probably won’t get their own stocking, so why not add one item per stocking for each of the family members? This way, they can give it to Spot or Fluffy themselves: Like a specialty dog biscuit, a dog brush, or a new cat toy.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.26.36_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256823" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">9. Toothbrush</h3>
<p class="p1">This one deserves its own mention, as we really should be changing our toothbrush more often folks! Christmas time is the perfect time to invest in a new toothbrush for each family member. Goodbye germs, hello sparkly teeth!</p>
<h3 class="p1">10. A new subscription</h3>
<p class="p1">There are so many great magazines being published out there, and something for everyone! Get them a copy of it, roll it up, and subscribe them to the latest online edition! We all need less time on our iPhones, and more time off to unplug. Plus, a subscription is the gift that keeps on giving year 'round!</p>
<h3 class="p2">11. Handmade IOUs</h3>
<p class="p2">This is one of our favourites, because it’s made by YOU! Create a little set of “IOUs” that they can redeem on a once-per-month basis: Redeem for a kitchen chore, a bathroom cleanup, raking the garden, or even for a kiss! The possibilities are endless, and these IOUs can make for the best gifts of all. Get creative! You know what they’ll love! Whether working IOUs, romantic IOUs, funny IOUs, they're such a lovely gift to receive (and fun to make!).</p>
<h3 class="p1">12. Candy: OUR FAVOURITE!</h3>
<p class="p1">Of course we had to make this our BEST Christmas stocking stuffer idea of all time! Here are some of our favourites for this year:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>If there is such a thing as a best time of year for candy, it’s Halloween!</strong> We all have great memories about trick or treating, and especially about going home and dumping the stash we collected on the table to sort out... and start devouring!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/halloween_candy_online_7b3bcded-cae5-4899-94bd-c1497625eff6.png?v=1599852410" alt="" width="518" height="339"></p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong></strong>It’s no secret: Kids love candy, and if you’re having a candy buffet party or it’s their birthday and you want to celebrate by ordering some specialty candy online, it’s sometimes difficult to know what is best to get for them!</p>
<p class="p2">We especially worry about those kiddos with allergies! Of course, every small child should be monitored constantly to make sure they’re putting the safest goodies in their mouths, and candies are no exception. We got you parents!! And we’re sharing our safest candies for kids with you, so you can have some peace of mind! </p>
<p class="p2"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.25.08_PM_medium.png?v=1594754730" alt="girl candy" width="427" height="325" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Allergens in candies</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There are some candies that pose a threat to children with allergies, as they may contain the recognized “top 8 allergens”. Those allergens can include milk, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat or gluten in general, soybean, fish, shellfish and eggs. These food allergens must legally be clearly declared on any candy label, as they account for 90% of all food allergens.</p>
<p class="p1">The safest candies that have no allergens include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-original-candies-61-5g" target="_blank" title="skittles" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles</strong></a> – These flavours are safe from the top 8 allergens: Original, sour, wild berry, tropical, orchards, and Desserts flavours.<br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.27.23_PM_medium.png?v=1594754863" alt="">

This includes the lime, lemon, orange, berry and raspberry flavours. Hurray!<br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.27.14_PM_medium.png?v=1594754888" alt="">

<li>
<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/starburst-gummibursts-flavor-duos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Starburst</strong></a> – At Mars, they ensure a comprehensive allergen management program, and so these favourites are included in the no-allergen list, for strawberry, lemon, orange and lime flavours. Thank you Mars!<br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.28.43_PM_large.png?v=1594754936" alt="" width="183" height="207">

</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Vegan and vegetarian safe candies:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It’s no secret that vegans and vegetarians love to eat as much as the next person, and candies are no exception!</p>
<p class="p2">There are some candies which aren’t suitable for vegans as they may be made using ingredients such as gelatin, carmine, lard, confectioners glaze, bone char, milk, eggs, or honey. The following are amazingly enjoyable candies which you CAN have, if you’re vegan or vegetarian, as they do not contain any of these top 8 allergens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airheads Taffy</li>
<li>Dots</li>
<li>Dum Dums</li>
<li>Ferrara Atomic FireBalls</li>
<li>Ferrara Chocolate Wafer Swirls</li>
<li>Cry Baby Candy</li>
<li>Fruit by the Foot</li>
<li>Haribo Sour S’ghetti Gummi Candy</li>
<li>Hubba Bubba Gum</li>
<li>Jolly Rancher Lollipops</li>
<li>Joyva Chocolate Covered Orange and also Raspberry Ring Jells</li>
<li>Jujubes</li>
<li>Jujyfruits</li>
<li>Lemonheads</li>
<li>Mary Jane Candy</li>
<li>Sour Patch Kids</li>
<li>Skittles</li>
<li>Smarties</li>
<li>Sweet Tarts</li>
<li>Tic Tac Mints</li>
<li>Twizzlers</li>
<li>Velamints</li>
<li>Zots</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.38.15_PM_medium.png?v=1594755516" alt="" width="458" height="309" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Safest candies for small children:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Although enjoying candies on a regular basis is probably not the best thing for small toddlers, if they are over 2 years old you can give them the occasional treat – as long as it’s kid-safe, allergen-free, and not a choking hazard! Never give your small child any hard candies, at least until they turn 4 years old – and even then, monitor them while they’re tasting it, and learning how to eat it! So basically that means, sitting down to eat it… not ever running around with candy in their mouths!</p>
<p class="p1">Also unsafe for little ones are things like candy corn, pumpkin or sesame seeds, and gummy candy, taffy and caramel, because they can easily slip down their throat, causing them to choke. </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>So what is safest?</strong> Soft candies are probably the safest you can occasionally give your toddler to enjoy. Goodies like cotton candy, milk chocolate bars, peanut butter cups, and chocolate-covered peppermint patties are pretty safe, as long as they’re pre-cut in tiny pieces, and you’re cleared for any allergic reactions to the top 8 allergens mentioned above, like peanuts/nuts, dairy, gluten, and eggs. <em><strong>Always let your kids taste it WITH YOU, never alone or unattended!</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">The relationship kids will develop with candy can be a sweet and rewarding one, and there is a candy for everyone’s tastes, and even cultures! Check out the extensive candy collections we have at Candy Funhouse, and start picking some of your children's favourites for their next party! Make theirs a memorable one –make it something they’ll remember fondly for years to come!</p>
