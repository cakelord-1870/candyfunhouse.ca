      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our good friend the Easter Bunny wants to know: Are you counting down the days until Easter? We definitely are!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easter is creeping up fast, and if there’s one thing you don’t want to be unprepared for, it’s that crazy last minute Easter candy shopping. Why go to a busy store and fight over the last bag of pretty pastel-coloured Easter candy when you can order everything you need to please your family and friends (and yourself!) right here online? (We promise we won’t hold it against you if you’re ordering from the couch in your pajamas with a glass of wine. Your secret is safe with us!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to know the secret to picking the absolute best Easter candy? It’s really simple: You need </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">variety</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Great Easter baskets never contain just one type of candy. From chocolates to hard candies, from sweet to sour, from classic candies to brand spankin’ new ones, picking a variety of Easter candy will make you everyone’s hero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part about shopping online at Candy Funhouse for Easter candy is that our candy connoisseurs have made the job super easy for you. If you need some timely inspiration on what to put in Easter baskets or hide on an Easter egg hunt, read on! We’ve got the low-down on the best Easter candy guaranteed to put smiles on the faces of your loved ones:</span></p>
<h3><b>The Best Easter Candy to Go in Your Easter Baskets</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many delightful candies you can include in your Easter baskets that will be sure to make your kiddos smile with delight. You can’t make a bad choice when it comes to Easter candy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our favourite Easter sweets has to be the</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/reese-miniature-cups"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reese’s Miniatures Peanut Butter Filled Chicks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What could be better than a Reese’s peanut butter cup? Lots of mini ones inside a festive yellow chick egg package! Everyone loves the classic peanut butter-chocolate combo that Reese’s is known for, so this Easter special is a no-brainer. You could also try the</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/reese-easter-egg"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reese’s Easter Egg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is just as cute </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great candy choice for any Easter basket are lollipops, especially the rainbow ones. Not only are these tasty, but they’ll add extra visual appeal to your baskets with a colourful twist! Candy Funhouse has some great lollipop options, including the</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/easter-candy/products/easter-curly-swirly-lollipop"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Easter Curly Swirly Lollipops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/easter-candy/products/easter-curly-swirly-egg-lollipop"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Easter Curly Swirly Egg Lollipops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Festive and bright, they are also shaped like a bunny and an egg, the perfect symbols for springtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no basket could be complete without the Canadian Easter classic—</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/easter-candy/products/cadbury-creme-egg"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cadbury Crème Eggs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Their thick chocolate shells hide a delicious surprise—yellow and white fondant that mimics the look of a chicken egg yolk. So good!  </span></p>
<h3><b>The Best Easter Candy for Your Easter Egg Hunt</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Easter egg hunt is usually the highlight of the day for many families, so why not “wow” your kids with not only your expert egg hiding skills, but also your amazing Easter egg candy selecting skills too?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the classic Easter candies are</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/easter-candy/products/cadbury-mini-eggs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cadbury Mini Eggs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/easter-candy/products/mini-whoppers-eggs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini Whoppers Eggs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/best-easter-candy-connoisseurs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reese’s Pieces Eggs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—all great chocolate choices that should make an appearance inside any plastic egg found on your hunt. But like we said before, variety when it comes to Easter candy makes things so much sweeter. So, mix things up on your egg hunt by also including some non-chocolate Easter candies, such as</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/mike-and-ike-easter-treats-theatre-pack"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike and Ike Easter Treats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/sweetarts-mini-gummy-bites"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetarts Mini Gummy Bites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding candy small enough to put into Easter eggs can be tough, but luckily, you have Candy Funhouse on your side. Our team of fun-gineers recommend using a combination of</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/sweetarts-mini-gummy-bites"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Laffy Taffys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (their chewy sweetness is addicting!),</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/hersheys-kisses-caramel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hershey’s Kisses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the yellow foil ones will make you think you’ve found gold!), and pastel-coloured</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/salt-water-taffy-bubble-gum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Salt Water Taffys</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (with a variety of flavours available, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubble Gum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  </span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/taffy/products/salt-water-taffy-blueberry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blueberry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/laffy-taffy-banana" target="_blank" title="Salt Water Taffy Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Laffy Taffy Banana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even</span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/taffy/products/salt-water-taffy-chocolate-chip-cookie"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chocolate Chip Cookie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
