<p>March Break is coming up and it's a great time to spend some quality time with the family. Candy Funhouse shares some ideas on how to make it even more special – even while staying safely at home!</p>
<p> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/unnamed_480x480.png?v=1612805256" alt="" width="520" height="116"></p>
<blockquote>
<h1><span style="color: #609f0d;">MARCH BREAK IS COMING!</span></h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Times may have changed, but people have not. After working so hard we all need a vacation, even if that means a Staycation! Time off work, time to catch up on some Netflix, maybe dust off the winter blues and start thinking of springtime ahead... with candy by your side!</p>
<h2>Here are some ways to make March Break happen for the whole family:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Game night. Every night! </strong> Schedule a game night with your family, and make your games revolve around candy. Our Candy Funhouse team put together this candy game blog <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/bring-in-the-new-year-with-candy-games" target="_blank" title="candy games" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>[HERE]</strong></a> with lots of sweet ideas to tie in with. Everyone loves a good game night, schedule it in!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.52.51_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803197" alt="" width="388" height="303"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>March Break around the world.</strong> Pick a country or region and dress up with that theme... One country per day = 7 days of fun! Make your candy online purchase selection match the different countries you're picking. For example, on "Mexican Day" you can have a taco dinner night, then <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/doritos-3d-crunch-chili-cheese-nacho-326g" target="_blank" title="3d nacho chips" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Doritos 3D Crunch Chili Cheese Nacho Chips</strong></a> while watching a Mexican film, followed by <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/efrutti-mexican-dinner" target="_blank" title="efrutti Mexican" rel="noopener noreferrer">efrutti Mexican Dinner</a></strong> gummies!  Candy Funhouse has online candy sales from Japan, British candy, Australian candy, and of course our very own Canadian candy - and this is cause for celebration!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.46.33_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803087" alt="" width="221" height="220"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.45.26_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803112" alt=""><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Celebrate Spring.</strong> March 20th is the first day of spring, so why not celebrate it early and get the family going on springtime fun-time? You can get the smaller kiddoes planting some seeds and for every seed they plant they get a special treat! On another day, take the kids on a drive to look at some of the early blooms surrounding the neighbourhood, like daffodils, crocuses and tulips - then they can match the colours they see with a colourful candy! Here are some favourites, including Australia's <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/australian-candy/products/lifesaver-tingles-fruit-aus-34g-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lifesaver Fruit Tingles</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-tropical-candies-61-5-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles Tropical</strong></a> candies, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jelly-belly-kids-mix-3-5oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jelly Belly Kids Mix</strong></a>, or even <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bigs-cheese-burger-sunflower-seeds-152-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bigs Cheese Burger</strong></a> sunflower seeds, which they'll love!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.59.37_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803770" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.00.40_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803787" alt=""><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.04.42_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803901" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.01.41_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803806" alt=""><br><br>

      <![CDATA[<p>Okay love birds: Some of us know that gifting anything for guys is just such a challenge – what do you get a man who won't fall for the fully gift-types, or maybe he's picky about clothing, or he already buys himself everything he needs? Short answer: <em>SWEETS</em>!</p>
<p>Candy Funhouse has put together some great ideas for you, so don't delay and order your candy online today in time for the most romantic day of the year!</p>
<p>What do you think about these BEST Valentine's Day gifts for men?</p>
<h3>Colour code it!</h3>
<p>Some guys are drawn to a particular colour because it may be their favourite team's colour, for example. Our friend Shirley shared her clever idea [<a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/320881542183672516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>] and we thought it was brilliant! Dare to be different by going BLUE rather than the typical RED for V-Day!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/320881542183672516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-01-18_at_11.17.43_AM_240x240.png?v=1610986790" alt="" width="386" height="483"></a></p>
<p>Some great ideas for BLUE treats for Valentine's Day include <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/maynards-sour-patch-kids-blue-raspberry-141g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sour Patch Kids Just Blue Raspberry,</strong></a> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/hersheys-kisses-cookies-and-cream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hershey's Kisses Cookies and Cream</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/brookside-dark-chocolate-acai-with-blueberry-7oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry,</strong></a> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/chips-ahoy-hersheys-chocolate-chip-cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chips Ahoy!
