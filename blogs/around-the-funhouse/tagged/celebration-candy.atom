<p>Times may have changed, but people have not. After working so hard we all need a vacation, even if that means a Staycation! Time off work, time to catch up on some Netflix, maybe dust off the winter blues and start thinking of springtime ahead... with candy by your side!</p>
<h2>Here are some ways to make March Break happen for the whole family:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Game night. Every night! </strong> Schedule a game night with your family, and make your games revolve around candy. Our Candy Funhouse team put together this candy game blog <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/bring-in-the-new-year-with-candy-games" target="_blank" title="candy games" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>[HERE]</strong></a> with lots of sweet ideas to tie in with. Everyone loves a good game night, schedule it in!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.52.51_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803197" alt="" width="388" height="303"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>March Break around the world.</strong> Pick a country or region and dress up with that theme... One country per day = 7 days of fun! Make your candy online purchase selection match the different countries you're picking. For example, on "Mexican Day" you can have a taco dinner night, then <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/doritos-3d-crunch-chili-cheese-nacho-326g" target="_blank" title="3d nacho chips" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Doritos 3D Crunch Chili Cheese Nacho Chips</strong></a> while watching a Mexican film, followed by <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/efrutti-mexican-dinner" target="_blank" title="efrutti Mexican" rel="noopener noreferrer">efrutti Mexican Dinner</a></strong> gummies!  Candy Funhouse has online candy sales from Japan, British candy, Australian candy, and of course our very own Canadian candy - and this is cause for celebration!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.46.33_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803087" alt="" width="221" height="220"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.45.26_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803112" alt=""><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Celebrate Spring.</strong> March 20th is the first day of spring, so why not celebrate it early and get the family going on springtime fun-time? You can get the smaller kiddoes planting some seeds and for every seed they plant they get a special treat! On another day, take the kids on a drive to look at some of the early blooms surrounding the neighbourhood, like daffodils, crocuses and tulips - then they can match the colours they see with a colourful candy! Here are some favourites, including Australia's <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/australian-candy/products/lifesaver-tingles-fruit-aus-34g-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lifesaver Fruit Tingles</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-tropical-candies-61-5-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles Tropical</strong></a> candies, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jelly-belly-kids-mix-3-5oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jelly Belly Kids Mix</strong></a>, or even <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bigs-cheese-burger-sunflower-seeds-152-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bigs Cheese Burger</strong></a> sunflower seeds, which they'll love!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.59.37_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803770" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.00.40_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803787" alt=""><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.04.42_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803901" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.01.41_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803806" alt=""><br><br>

Here's some fun candy games for the whole gang at home.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/bring-in-the-new-year-with-candy-games">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"> Celebrating the New Year should be a feel-good thing, right? Especially if you’ve had a challenging year, like many of us have! This New Year, make it super special while staying safe and enjoying the time with your loved ones. How do we do that at Candy Funhouse? With candy, of course!</p>
<p class="p1">Many of us love going out for New Year, having parties, or hosting get-togethers with our besties, for New Year. If this is not a possibility, why not stay safe and cozy at home and play some candy games?</p>
<p class="p2">At Candy Funhouse, we know that everyone loves playing games; it’s an easy way to pass the time while having fun, and way better for quality time rather than everyone spending it on their own phone. Especially for events like New Year, it’s important to spend the time together, doing things that are fun, and making it memorable.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are some ideas for you to play some fun candy games, whether you're looking for kids candy games, adult candy games, or candy games for the whole family to enjoy:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">KIDS CANDY GAMES</h2>
<p class="p1">If you’re staying at home with young kids, there are many games you can play using candy. They’ll love these because they’re not only fun, but they get to eat the candy too!</p>
<h3 class="p2">“Sweet Tac Toe”</h3>
<p class="p1">Set up a board with a Tic Tac Toe drawn on it, and use <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/reeses-big-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Reese’s Pieces Big Cups</strong></a> (39g) for one player, and <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/york-peppermint-patty" target="_blank" title="york" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>York Peppermint Pattie</strong></a> (39g) for the other player. In this version, the winner gets to take a bite out of each candy that has crossed – not eat the whole thing at once (39g is a lot… they’re quite large!). Then keep taking tuns until someone finishes their candy bar first! You can also play with other candies like Hershey’s Kisses, and every player gets a different coloured foil – a great way to try the new flavours too, like Mint Kisses and Lava Cake Dark Chocolate Kisses!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.25.44_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548232" alt="" width="236" height="161"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.26.01_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548258" alt="" width="171" height="231"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">“Twizzlers Nibs Building Challenge”</h3>
<p class="p1">– Photo courtesy of our friends at <a href="FrogsAndSnailsAndPuppyDogTail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FrogsAndSnailsAndPuppyDogTail.com</a></p>
<p class="p1">These guys really have it together, and what a great idea this is! Jaime is a mother of three high-energy boys, who loves creating and crafting together. This game is one of her mastermind ideas and we’re loving it! You can use a few packets of Twizzlers Nibs candy and use toothpicks to connect them, building challenging forts, ‘cars’ and roads for a whole lotta fun!</p>
<p class="p1">You can have the kids (or you!) use both cherry and dark licorice Twizzlers Nibs, and get the multi-coloured toothpicks to connect them. How fun! <strong>Check out the varieties Candy Funhouse has, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=twizzlers+nibs" target="_blank" title="nibs" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>. </strong></p>

<h2 class="p1"></h2>
<h2 class="p1">ADULT CANDY GAMES</h2>
<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we already know what happens when you mix Mentos with Coca Cola… But there are better ways to have fun and get to actually EAT the candy you’re playing with! How about we share a couple of ideas with you for New Year’s?</p>
<h3 class="p1">“Marshies Picking Game” </h3>
<p class="p1">Use chopsticks and small marshmallows like <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=marshmallows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Marshies</strong></a> Strawberry or Chocolate/Vanilla, or Mango flavours (they’re just so good, and there are so many flavours!). Set the timer and see who gets to pick more Marshies with their toothpicks… The winner has to stuff all the ones they picked into their mouth at once, while the rest of you watch and take selfies! Order your candy Marshies online <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=marshmallows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.39.39_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548498" alt="" width="165" height="192"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.39.42_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548517" alt="" width="154" height="172"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.39.45_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548540" alt="" width="170" height="182"></p>
<h3 class="p1">“Suck ‘em Sweet”</h3>
<p class="p1">This game can also use small <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=marshmallows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>marshmallows</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=m+m%26m%27s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M&amp;Ms</strong></a> or <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=smarties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Smarties</strong></a> (or all of them together in a bowl!). Every player gets a bowl of candies, and an empty bowl. The object of the game is to use a straw to suck one candy at a time from the candy bowl, onto the empty candy bowl, using a timer (you can use the one on your phone). The fastest person to get them all to the empty bowl wins! What do they win? That’s up to the organizer of course… Maybe it’s a special treat, or something more adult-like… or maybe they get to eat everyone’s treats!</p>

<h3 class="p1">“Truth or Sweet”</h3>
<p class="p1">Yes, it’s <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.48.50_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548848" alt="" width="211" height="270" style="float: left;">kind of like <em>Truth or Dare</em> but where the dare is a treat. The object of the game is to get yourself a <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/m-ms-milk-chocolate-candies-pantry-size-62-oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pantry Size jug of M&amp;M’s</strong></a>, and divvy up some between each player – everyone gets their own paper cup of them, about a large handful is good. Next, you need to decide what each colour means, for example: The red ones will be a ‘dare’, the blue ones will be a kiss or a hug; the yellow ones will be a ‘truth’, and so on… You can even play a fun strip-candy game, or make them all dares! Each player takes a turn clockwise, picking a colour from their opponent’s candy cup, doing the truth or dare, and enjoying their candy! </p>
