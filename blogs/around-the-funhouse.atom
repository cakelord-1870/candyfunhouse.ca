<p>March Break is coming up and it's a great time to spend some quality time with the family. Candy Funhouse shares some ideas on how to make it even more special – even while staying safely at home!</p>
<p> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/unnamed_480x480.png?v=1612805256" alt="" width="520" height="116"></p>
<blockquote>
<h1><span style="color: #609f0d;">MARCH BREAK IS COMING!</span></h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Times may have changed, but people have not. After working so hard we all need a vacation, even if that means a Staycation! Time off work, time to catch up on some Netflix, maybe dust off the winter blues and start thinking of springtime ahead... with candy by your side!</p>
<h2>Here are some ways to make March Break happen for the whole family:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Game night. Every night! </strong> Schedule a game night with your family, and make your games revolve around candy. Our Candy Funhouse team put together this candy game blog <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/bring-in-the-new-year-with-candy-games" target="_blank" title="candy games" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>[HERE]</strong></a> with lots of sweet ideas to tie in with. Everyone loves a good game night, schedule it in!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.52.51_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803197" alt="" width="388" height="303"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>March Break around the world.</strong> Pick a country or region and dress up with that theme... One country per day = 7 days of fun! Make your candy online purchase selection match the different countries you're picking. For example, on "Mexican Day" you can have a taco dinner night, then <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/doritos-3d-crunch-chili-cheese-nacho-326g" target="_blank" title="3d nacho chips" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Doritos 3D Crunch Chili Cheese Nacho Chips</strong></a> while watching a Mexican film, followed by <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/efrutti-mexican-dinner" target="_blank" title="efrutti Mexican" rel="noopener noreferrer">efrutti Mexican Dinner</a></strong> gummies!  Candy Funhouse has online candy sales from Japan, British candy, Australian candy, and of course our very own Canadian candy - and this is cause for celebration!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.46.33_AM_480x480.png?v=1612803087" alt="" width="221" height="220"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.45.26_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803112" alt=""><br><br>

<strong>Celebrate Spring.</strong> March 20th is the first day of spring, so why not celebrate it early and get the family going on springtime fun-time? You can get the smaller kiddoes planting some seeds and for every seed they plant they get a special treat! On another day, take the kids on a drive to look at some of the early blooms surrounding the neighbourhood, like daffodils, crocuses and tulips - then they can match the colours they see with a colourful candy! Here are some favourites, including Australia's <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/australian-candy/products/lifesaver-tingles-fruit-aus-34g-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lifesaver Fruit Tingles</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-tropical-candies-61-5-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles Tropical</strong></a> candies, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/jelly-belly-kids-mix-3-5oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jelly Belly Kids Mix</strong></a>, or even <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bigs-cheese-burger-sunflower-seeds-152-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bigs Cheese Burger</strong></a> sunflower seeds, which they'll love!<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_11.59.37_AM_240x240.png?v=1612803770" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.00.40_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803787" alt=""><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.04.42_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803901" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_12.01.41_PM_240x240.png?v=1612803806" alt=""><br><br>

      <![CDATA[<p>Okay love birds: Some of us know that gifting anything for guys is just such a challenge – what do you get a man who won't fall for the fully gift-types, or maybe he's picky about clothing, or he already buys himself everything he needs? Short answer: <em>SWEETS</em>!</p>
<p>Candy Funhouse has put together some great ideas for you, so don't delay and order your candy online today in time for the most romantic day of the year!</p>
<p>What do you think about these BEST Valentine's Day gifts for men?</p>
<h3>Colour code it!</h3>
<p>Some guys are drawn to a particular colour because it may be their favourite team's colour, for example. Our friend Shirley shared her clever idea [<a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/320881542183672516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>] and we thought it was brilliant! Dare to be different by going BLUE rather than the typical RED for V-Day!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Did you know that certain candies, snacks, and treats can actually help fight stress? Candy Funhouse has just the thing for that! </strong></p>
<p class="p1">This time of year can sure be stressful, and on top of it all, it has been a challenging year for many of us! Let’s get through it and see how the next candies to order online should include those that fight stress.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Chewing gum to fight stress</h2>
<p class="p1">The act of chewing gum has been shown to send those “satisfying” signals to our stress-suffering brains, much like eating food does. When you chew gum and on top of that combine it with that sweet or minty flavour, you’re actually sending calming vibes to your brain, dude! They’re called ‘endorphins’, and they make us happy… so go ahead and order some awesome chewing gum online and chew on!</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Here are a whole bunch of some of our favourite [<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results?type=product&amp;amp;q=gum*" target="_blank" title="gum" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUM</a>] treats:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_1.07.13_PM_240x240.png?v=1609959152" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_1.07.29_PM_240x240.png?v=1609959178" alt="" width="148" height="126"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_1.07.44_PM_240x240.png?v=1609959204" alt="" width="112" height="149"></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Shockingly sour candies to fight stress:</h2>
<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we love sour candies so much we even wrote a whole [<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/pucker-up-our-top-10-sourest-candy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>BLOG</strong></a>] about the most sour, favourite ones! Did you know that when you’re feeling stressed out one of the best things you can do is shock your tastebuds into flavourtown? That cheek-squeezing, tart reaction you have from sucking on a super sour candy automatically distracts your brain from the thing that is causing you stress, creating calming feelings… it’s true!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Some of Candy Funhouse’s most memorable [<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/sour-candy" target="_blank" title="sour candy lineup" rel="noopener noreferrer">sour candies</a>] to shock you into happiness include these favourites:</strong></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Crunch it out!</h2>
<p class="p1">Snacking makes a brain happy. Some people snack because they’re bored, others snack out of stress. All you need to do is order a variety of different snacks and mix them all up into one big bowl! You’ll be feeling comforted right away… but please snack responsibly!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you think about these awesome crunchable snacks?</strong> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results?type=product&amp;amp;q=snacks*" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>[One click]</strong></a> and they’ll be on your online candy purchase basket! We have salty snacks, crunchie-munchie snacks with combination sweet and salty, and the best treats for the munchies:</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_1.00.58_PM_240x240.png?v=1609959394" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_1.01.05_PM_240x240.png?v=1609959410" alt=""></p>

<h2 class="p1">Chocolate is KING!</h2>
<p class="p1">Our Candy Funhouse team thinks this was a fitting title, since the first thing many of us reach out for when feeling anxious or sad, or even stressed out, is chocolate. You may have heard that chocolate is linked to our bodies producing “serotonins” right? Those are the neurotransmitters that make us feel happy. So pick your favourite choco-treats and order your chocolate lineup online straight away!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"> At Candy Funhouse we have a big following of bakers, and Valentine’s Day is one of the best ways to get right into baking with some favourite toppings!</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you’re planning on baking some cookies, cakes, or special treats for those you love this Valentine’s Day, what better way than to add special toppings that they wouldn’t be expecting… and ship these cookies overnight to your loved ones at the safety of their own home (or office!).</p>
<p class="p2"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-20_at_2.36.47_PM_480x480.png?v=1608493038" alt="" width="520" height="348"></p>
<h2 class="p1">EASY SUGAR COOKIE RECIPE</h2>
<p class="p1">The dough can be a simple sugar cookie, and here is one of our favourite recipes you can start with as your base, before your add Candy Funhouse’s huge collection of sweet cookie toppings - check them out <strong>[<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/baking-toppings" target="_blank" title="toppings" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>]</strong></p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>2-1/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>3/4 cup of butter, softened to room temperature (don’t microwave it!)</li>
<li>3/4 cup of sugar (white or brown, either one is fine!)</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (or you can try orange extract, it’s delicious!)</li>
<li>lemon rind (optional, for that extra zing!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Method:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a medium sized bowl, mix the first 3 ingredients and set aside</li>
<li>Using a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and smooth – it should look a bit lighter and fluffier. Then add the egg, extract, and rind if using.</li>
<li>Then, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix on low until well combined (if the dough is too soft you can refrigerate it for 30 minutes, divided into 4 sections, in some plastic wrap).</li>
<li>Here’s where you can add some topping INSIDE the cookies, if you want! (See below for options).</li>
<li>Heat oven to 350°F.</li>
<li>Proceed to roll the dough out on a floured surface, and shape cookies.</li>
<li>Arrange on a baking sheet that has been covered with parchment paper, and bake for 10-12 minutes until lightly browned.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Once your cookies are cooled and the icing has been spread onto them, let the sweet fun begin! Here are some great options for toppings you can add to your Valentine’s Day cookies:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we are <strong>BIG on LOVE!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></strong>Although Valentine’s Day is February 14th, we like to think we can celebrate love and kindness all year round – especially this coming year! </p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons why we celebrate Valentine’s Day – it’s tradition, it’s history, it’s exciting, it’s a whole month of celebrating those you love!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-07_at_2.57.55_PM_480x480.png?v=1607371102" alt="" width="516" height="345"></p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to limit your Valentine’s Day celebrations to just a ‘special someone’. Many people may not have a significant other, they may choose to live the single lifestyle – and we think that is just swell as long as that’s what makes you happy!</p>
<p class="p1">You can order some candy online from Candy Funhouse, just because it’s the BEST way to get it: By mail! Imagine looking in your mailbox and seeing that your online candy order has arrived? Woo-hoo!</p>
<p class="p1">These past few months have been a challenge for all of us, plus it’s Winter so it’s not always to visit family and friends. Let them know you are thinking about them and order some candy, treats, and chocolates online now so they get it way before Valentine’s Day arrives! Beat the rush, surprise them NOW!</p>
<h2 class="p1">Retro online candy for your parents:</h2>
<p class="p1">Candy Funhouse’s extensive collection of vintage and nostalgic (retro!) candy will remind them of their youth, of what their parents would bring home for them, of times past… And this is always a nice feeling, right?

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s that time of year, and what a year it has been! At Candy Funhouse we’re all about making those around you happy – and what better way than celebrating Christmas with candy!</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you started your Christmas shopping early at your local retailers, or if you finished ordering your gifts online, Christmas is never quite complete without the traditional stocking stuffers.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.05_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256722" alt="" width="531" height="355"></p>
<p class="p1">Christmas stockings have been around for centuries, and they’re the “bonus” that many kids – and adults! – look for on Christmas morning. Customs vary from country to country, for example, in many Asian countries it is still customary to give your friends and loved ones apples, which have been lovingly and creatively decorated and wrapped in pretty, colourful paper. Love that! And in Mexico, the Christmas piñata is still practised, with toys and candies abound.</p>
<p class="p1">We still prefer the stocking, and filling it can seem like a challenge… Until you check out Candy Funhouse’s Best Stocking Stuffer ideas for Christmas! Here are the top 12 ideas for what to put in your stockings this year:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">1. Cosmetics</h3>
<p class="p1">Not just for teens, but for moms and dads too! A specialty shaving kit for dad, a fancy night cream for mom, a new special sparkly nail polish for sis, and how about a fun little soap set for the toddler?</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Socks, of course!</h3>
<p class="p1">A stocking wouldn’t be quite the same without some new fun socks! Wrap them separately and make them UNmatchable… Because, who says socks have to match? Give each one of your kids a sock that doesn’t match, and let them figure it out!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.25.52_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256776" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Favourite fruit</h3>
<p class="p1">Add their favourite fruit – like a mango, a passion fruit, kiwi, or something different from abroad they may never have tried, like a lychee fruit, a pomegranate, or a star fruit. It’ll make for fun conversation too! Fruit has been stuffed into a Christmas stocking for AGES, why stop now?</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Jewelry</h3>
<p class="p1">It doesn’t have to be fancy, but even the smallest token of jewelry makes everyone smile! Like a button pin, different kind of earrings they’d never buy for themselves, cufflinks for the guys, or a cute little pendant.</p>
<h3 class="p1">5. Hair stuff</h3>
<p class="p1">We all need these, and we all run out of these – especially if you like doing ‘stuff’ with your hair! How about a new hairbrush, clips, and new fancy hair elastics?</p>
<h3 class="p1">6. Cards</h3>
<p class="p1">That’s “playing cards” for you! There are tons that are even sold at the local dollar store with different pictures on them, from Barbie to My Little Pony, Star Wars to the all-popular Yoda.</p>
<h3 class="p1">7. Eco items</h3>
<p class="p1">With the eco-craze going on right now, and since we’re all trying to avoid plastics, how about adding some paper straws to your stockings? There’s also traveling cutlery sets, and reusable collapsible cups. Help out Mother Earth this Christmas too!</p>
<h3 class="p1">8. Pet items</h3>
<p class="p1">They probably won’t get their own stocking, so why not add one item per stocking for each of the family members? This way, they can give it to Spot or Fluffy themselves: Like a specialty dog biscuit, a dog brush, or a new cat toy.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-24_at_5.26.36_PM_480x480.png?v=1606256823" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">9. Toothbrush</h3>
<p class="p1">This one deserves its own mention, as we really should be changing our toothbrush more often folks! Christmas time is the perfect time to invest in a new toothbrush for each family member. Goodbye germs, hello sparkly teeth!</p>
<h3 class="p1">10. A new subscription</h3>
<p class="p1">There are so many great magazines being published out there, and something for everyone! Get them a copy of it, roll it up, and subscribe them to the latest online edition! We all need less time on our iPhones, and more time off to unplug. Plus, a subscription is the gift that keeps on giving year 'round!</p>
<h3 class="p2">11. Handmade IOUs</h3>
<p class="p2">This is one of our favourites, because it’s made by YOU! Create a little set of “IOUs” that they can redeem on a once-per-month basis: Redeem for a kitchen chore, a bathroom cleanup, raking the garden, or even for a kiss! The possibilities are endless, and these IOUs can make for the best gifts of all. Get creative! You know what they’ll love! Whether working IOUs, romantic IOUs, funny IOUs, they're such a lovely gift to receive (and fun to make!).</p>
<h3 class="p1">12. Candy: OUR FAVOURITE!</h3>
<p class="p1">Of course we had to make this our BEST Christmas stocking stuffer idea of all time! Here are some of our favourites for this year:</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"> Celebrating the New Year should be a feel-good thing, right? Especially if you’ve had a challenging year, like many of us have! This New Year, make it super special while staying safe and enjoying the time with your loved ones. How do we do that at Candy Funhouse? With candy, of course!</p>
<p class="p1">Many of us love going out for New Year, having parties, or hosting get-togethers with our besties, for New Year. If this is not a possibility, why not stay safe and cozy at home and play some candy games?</p>
<p class="p2">At Candy Funhouse, we know that everyone loves playing games; it’s an easy way to pass the time while having fun, and way better for quality time rather than everyone spending it on their own phone. Especially for events like New Year, it’s important to spend the time together, doing things that are fun, and making it memorable.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are some ideas for you to play some fun candy games, whether you're looking for kids candy games, adult candy games, or candy games for the whole family to enjoy:</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">KIDS CANDY GAMES</h2>
<p class="p1">If you’re staying at home with young kids, there are many games you can play using candy. They’ll love these because they’re not only fun, but they get to eat the candy too!</p>
<h3 class="p2">“Sweet Tac Toe”</h3>
<p class="p1">Set up a board with a Tic Tac Toe drawn on it, and use <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/reeses-big-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Reese’s Pieces Big Cups</strong></a> (39g) for one player, and <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/york-peppermint-patty" target="_blank" title="york" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>York Peppermint Pattie</strong></a> (39g) for the other player. In this version, the winner gets to take a bite out of each candy that has crossed – not eat the whole thing at once (39g is a lot… they’re quite large!). Then keep taking tuns until someone finishes their candy bar first! You can also play with other candies like Hershey’s Kisses, and every player gets a different coloured foil – a great way to try the new flavours too, like Mint Kisses and Lava Cake Dark Chocolate Kisses!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.25.44_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548232" alt="" width="236" height="161"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.26.01_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548258" alt="" width="171" height="231"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">“Twizzlers Nibs Building Challenge”</h3>
<p class="p1">– Photo courtesy of our friends at <a href="FrogsAndSnailsAndPuppyDogTail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FrogsAndSnailsAndPuppyDogTail.com</a></p>
<p class="p1">These guys really have it together, and what a great idea this is! Jaime is a mother of three high-energy boys, who loves creating and crafting together. This game is one of her mastermind ideas and we’re loving it! You can use a few packets of Twizzlers Nibs candy and use toothpicks to connect them, building challenging forts, ‘cars’ and roads for a whole lotta fun!</p>
<p class="p1">You can have the kids (or you!) use both cherry and dark licorice Twizzlers Nibs, and get the multi-coloured toothpicks to connect them. How fun! <strong>Check out the varieties Candy Funhouse has, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=twizzlers+nibs" target="_blank" title="nibs" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>. </strong></p>
<p class="p1"> <a href="frogsandsnailsandpuppydogtail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Twizzlers-Nibs-Building-Challenge.-Fun-STEM-game-for-kids-768x1210_480x480.jpg?v=1605548359" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.32.38_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548408" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.32.41_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548425" alt=""></p>
<h2 class="p1"></h2>
<h2 class="p1">ADULT CANDY GAMES</h2>
<p class="p1">At Candy Funhouse, we already know what happens when you mix Mentos with Coca Cola… But there are better ways to have fun and get to actually EAT the candy you’re playing with! How about we share a couple of ideas with you for New Year’s?</p>
<h3 class="p1">“Marshies Picking Game” </h3>
<p class="p1">Use chopsticks and small marshmallows like <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=marshmallows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Marshies</strong></a> Strawberry or Chocolate/Vanilla, or Mango flavours (they’re just so good, and there are so many flavours!). Set the timer and see who gets to pick more Marshies with their toothpicks… The winner has to stuff all the ones they picked into their mouth at once, while the rest of you watch and take selfies! Order your candy Marshies online <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=marshmallows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.39.39_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548498" alt="" width="165" height="192"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.39.42_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548517" alt="" width="154" height="172"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.39.45_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548540" alt="" width="170" height="182"></p>
<h3 class="p1">“Suck ‘em Sweet”</h3>
<p class="p1">This game can also use small <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=marshmallows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>marshmallows</strong></a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=m+m%26m%27s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M&amp;Ms</strong></a> or <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=smarties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Smarties</strong></a> (or all of them together in a bowl!). Every player gets a bowl of candies, and an empty bowl. The object of the game is to use a straw to suck one candy at a time from the candy bowl, onto the empty candy bowl, using a timer (you can use the one on your phone). The fastest person to get them all to the empty bowl wins! What do they win? That’s up to the organizer of course… Maybe it’s a special treat, or something more adult-like… or maybe they get to eat everyone’s treats!</p>
<p class="p1"><em>(Thanks to Sophie’s World for the fun photo... check out the full video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k_Pc4Hw3Rk" target="_blank" title="see video" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>!)</em></p>
<p class="p2"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k_Pc4Hw3Rk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/mm-suck-game-1_0_480x480.png?v=1605548763" alt="candy game" width="518" height="345"></a></p>
<h3 class="p1">“Truth or Sweet”</h3>
<p class="p1">Yes, it’s <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_11.48.50_AM_480x480.png?v=1605548848" alt="" width="211" height="270" style="float: left;">kind of like <em>Truth or Dare</em> but where the dare is a treat. The object of the game is to get yourself a <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/m-ms-milk-chocolate-candies-pantry-size-62-oz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pantry Size jug of M&amp;M’s</strong></a>, and divvy up some between each player – everyone gets their own paper cup of them, about a large handful is good. Next, you need to decide what each colour means, for example: The red ones will be a ‘dare’, the blue ones will be a kiss or a hug; the yellow ones will be a ‘truth’, and so on… You can even play a fun strip-candy game, or make them all dares! Each player takes a turn clockwise, picking a colour from their opponent’s candy cup, doing the truth or dare, and enjoying their candy! </p>
<p class="p1">When someone asks you, “what did you do for New Year?” what are you going to say? Make sure it’s a fun thing, because we all need a wonderful celebration to bring in a New Year full of hope, happiness, and health... And have fun with candy!</p>
<p class="p1">Now go ahead and start picking your candy from Candy Funhouse’s huge selection, buy your candy online in Canada, select your games, and plan an evening that will be memorable!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Without a doubt, 2020 has been a challenging year for all of us – for many (many!) reasons. And now Winter is here and we’re starting to see all the Holiday decorations popping up on the streets and stores. Is it too soon to begin celebrating? Is the Holiday Season causing you anxiety?</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.32.30_PM_480x480.png?v=1604950991" alt="christmas safe party" width="525" height="349"></p>
<p class="p1">At CandyFunhouse, we believe we ALL deserve this time to celebrate. Whether you’re safely staying in your own home or having a couple of people in your “bubble” join you for a distanced get-together, candy may just be the thing to cheer everyone up.</p>
<p class="p1">The fact that decorations are popping up may just be a good thing. It’s a change of scenery, and a reminder of days when we spent good times together. Here’s some tips on making it the BEST Holiday Season ever!</p>
<h3 class="p1">Distanced, not silenced.</h3>
<p class="p1">This may just be the best year to bring back the Holiday Card. Time to make a list of those people you appreciate this year, those you haven’t had an opportunity to see, and those you think could use just a little pick me up! Take just five minutes to write them each a little note (it doesn’t even have to be fancy or lengthy!) and pop in a sweet treat for them to enjoy, like a baggie of <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/haribo-berries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Haribo Berries Gummies,</strong></a> or you could even buy a bag of <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/dum-dums-color-party-assorted-rainbow-lollipops-75-ct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dum Dums Color Party Assorted Rainbow Lollipops</strong></a> and divvy it up among your best friends!</p>

<h3 class="p1">Make it DIFFERENT.</h3>
<p class="p1">Maybe it’s time to change it up, and look at a sweet yummy treat that was made abroad. Sending a little gift to someone special doesn’t mean it has to always be the typical goodies they are familiar with. At Candy Funhouse, we have a HUGE collection of <strong><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=small+chocolate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ritter Sport chocolates</a>,</strong> for example. These super-good chocolates are made by a small German family business that was established in 1912. They have a big variety of flavours too! Can you imagine how happy they would be to try them all, or even a few different ones? Like Chocolate with <strong>Strawberry Joghurt, Milk Chocolate with Coconut, Dark Chocolate Peppermint, or even some with Marzipan?</strong> This is your opportunity to shine, to share something <strong>NEW</strong> with someone, at a time when they really need that bit of excitement!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.36.01_PM_100x100.png?v=1604951185" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.36.05_PM_100x100.png?v=1604951203" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.36.11_PM_100x100.png?v=1604951219" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.36.23_PM_100x100.png?v=1604951236" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.36.16_PM_100x100.png?v=1604951268" alt=""></p>
<h3 class="p1">Choose a “Gift That Keeps On Giving”.</h3>
<p class="p1">If there’s someone in your life who has had a particularly difficult time this year, show them you’re there for them EVERY MONTH! <strong>Candy Funhouse’s Care Package Subscription Box</strong> means they’ll receive a new and exciting flavour from around the Funhouse every month. We all need a little excitement right now, so go on, even YOU could enjoy a Candy Funhouse Care subscription box, right? Check it out <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/candy-care-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.37.27_PM_480x480.png?v=1604951347" alt="" width="514" height="443"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">The Outdoor Holiday Party.</h3>
<p class="p1">There’s no reason why we can’t barbecue through the winter months, right? Just like there’s no reason why we can’t arrange an outdoor get-together with our closest safe contacts through the Holidays and New Year. Each person can bring their own chair (BYOC) and their own drinks (BYOD) – you just have to make it a sweet get-together outside! Set up a table and decorate it accordingly. Then, set up some paper plates and pre-package some specialty candies, chocolates, and snacks in goodie bags. Everyone can come, help themselves to a loot bag, and sip on some cocoa on a sunny winter weekend morning. You can even schedule different times for different friends to come by, as long as they’re in your social bubble, of course!</p>
<h3 class="p1">Don’t forget the barbecue!</h3>
<p class="p1">If you don’t have a fire pit, you can still set up the barbecue and roast some <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=marshmallows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>marshmallows</strong></a>! This is another SAFE way to share in some sweets too, as everyone can pick-a-stick, poke their own marshmallow through it, and roast it to their liking… Just imagine how good <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/haribo-primavera-erdbeeren-175-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Haribo’s Primavera strawberry marshmallows</strong></a> would taste lightly toasted up and all gooey delicious! And <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/mccormicks-marshmallow-bananas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>McCormicks Banana Marshmallows</strong></a> can ALSO be roasted over an open fire… oh yeah! Just use a cast-iron pan and you're all set! After the party’s done, all the sticks and paper plates get burned so no mess to clean up. Bonus!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.33.56_PM_240x240.png?v=1604951433" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.34.22_PM_240x240.png?v=1604951512" alt=""></p>
<p class="p1">Don’t feel guilty for starting to get excited about the Holiday season… At Candy Funhouse, we believe we all need these little sweet celebrations, especially this year! So go ahead and order your online candy from our immense selection and make it a time to remember.</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter which country you’re from or what your culture or religion, candy is a favourite treat to enjoy at many festivities and special holidays in Canada and around the world. Some of these special celebrations will include a feast, family gatherings, lighting of candles, moments of silence followed by festivities, and special days that will have customary foods and yes, sweets!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the most familiar celebrations include Christmas, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Immaculate_Conception" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feast of the Immaculate Conception</a>, <a href="https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pancha Ganapati</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Las-Posadas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posadas</a>, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/hanukkah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanukkah</a>, <a href="http://www.holidayscalendar.com/event/yule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yule</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diwali</a>, and <a href="http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CO%5CKoliadaIT.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koliada</a>. <strong>Have you heard of most of these special holidays celebrated around the world? </strong></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to incorporate sweets into your celebrations</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Candy Funhouse, we know candy is the universal language of happiness! Candy makes a great gift to give someone, no matter if their background is different than yours. When you’re not too sure what to gift them but you want to support their culture, you can put together a basket with special treats for them: Use your imagination, use colour variations, shapes, sizes, and mix chocolates with candies of all shapes and sizes!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-02_at_3.16.17_PM_480x480.png?v=1604348368" alt="Candy basket for the Holidays" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Support someone else’s different culture, with candy:</span></strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you are familiar with someone’s background, it’ll be a special moment for them to receive a package with sweets and treats that show you are interested and support them. Maybe the event or celebration is not something you grew up with, but you bet it means a lot to them! In some celebrations, there is a period of fasting… followed by a celebration with lots of special foods and yes, candy!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-02_at_3.15.32_PM_480x480.png?v=1604348429" alt="Diwali Candy" width="516" height="340" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Boost mood at the office with candy:</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Candies can be used as decorations throughout your office too! Colourful decorations that are red and green, or maybe multicoloured for a Diwali theme, for example, with an awesome collection of candy and chocolates – even salty snacks and crunchy treats! This can immediately boost morale at any office, and we could all sure use that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-02_at_3.15.22_PM_480x480.png?v=1604348472" alt="Candy for the office" width="525" height="338"></span></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Candy more than just three times per year!</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We think of chocolate for Valentine’s Day, Easter, and Halloween, but we need to celebrate by treating ourselves more often! It can make us smile, cheer us up, boost the energy level and make our day so much happier! You’ve probably heard of people celebrating <em>Christmas in July</em>, so why not <em>Valentine’s Day in August, or Chocolate day ANYTIME?</em> The wonderful Indian celebration of Diwali, for example, is also known as the “festival of lights” with – of course – lights, foods, music, dancing, and celebration… adding an assortment of colourful candies makes this celebration even happier, more enjoyable, as it’s intertwined with the typical delicacies and treats.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-11-02_at_3.15.05_PM_480x480.png?v=1604348508" alt="Candy in August" width="524" height="349"></span></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t forget about yourself!</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We like to think of others during special holidays, wondering what they’ll want as gifts and how we can make them happy. This is all good, of course, but while you’re planning to make them happy, don’t forget to treat yourself too! Sometimes it’s much more than a trip to the grocery store for dinner items; sometimes you need to add an order of online candy from Candy Funhouse to make it a fun, festive, and sweet holiday celebration! Think of what you like too –<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>feel like having some special nostalgic chocolates that remind you of childhood? Candy Funhouse has that! Do you want to indulge in some salty and crunchy snacks to go along with your holiday home-baked cookies? Candy Funhouse has a huge selection, check out Candy Funhouse’s fresh snack collection <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/snacks" target="_blank" title="Snacks collection" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/collections/new-items" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/candy-funhouse-snacks_480x480.jpg?v=1604177548" alt="" width="510" height="275"></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><span class="s1">The many special multicultural events and Holidays we celebrate, can bring us together. They are special moments through the year where we can take time to relax, celebrate, think of family and friends, and enjoy some comfort foods… like sweet and sour candies, ooey gooey chocolatey treats, salty and crunchy munchies, and more. When you celebrate your special holiday this year, count on Candy Funhouse to be there for you.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the most fun things about Christmas-time is seeing everyone’s homes and streets decorated. And just about anything goes these days!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_5.30.03_PM_480x480.png?v=1603143058" alt="christmas decorated home" width="534" height="219"></p>
<p class="p1">There’s the typical red and green decorations, maybe with some gold or sparkling silver; there’s the classy white tree with blue or red decorations. Some people prefer whimsical while others prefer classic. At Candy Funhouse we like it crunchy, salty, gooey, and especially SWEET! </p>
<p class="p1">There are many ways to decorate your home, and this year we’re showing you how you can incorporate candy into your deco. Candy Funhouse has scoured the internet for some fantastic ideas, and here we share them with you!</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Make it a sweet Christmas tree</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/chistmasTreeIdeas_480x480.jpg?v=1603133076" alt="" style="float: left;"></h2>
<div style="text-align: start;">Right from the get-go, the tree: Add some candy canes for sure, and also add some other sweet treats and yummy goodies that will bring out the child at heart. You can use some simple garland or ribbon to tie some of our favourites, like apple-flavoured <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/gummy-rings-apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Albanese Gummi Rings,</strong></a> which are so easy to loop through because of their shape; sour green apple <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/dum-dums-color-party-bright-green-lollipops-75-ct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dum Dums lollipops</strong></a>, which you can easily hang upside down while tying them from the stick; and <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/crazy-candy-factory-strawberry-laces-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Crazy Candy Factory’s strawberry laces,</strong> </a>and you can even use them to tie small gifts! There are soooo many sweet ideas and pretty much any candy can be placed on the tree (just make sure your pets and small kids can't reach them!).</div>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Check out this <a href="https://gracemonroehome.com/how-to-create-a-candy-christmas-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super handy blog</a> that shows you a step-by-step guide on how to decorate your Christmas Tree Using Candy!</strong></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>

<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_4.22.12_PM_480x480.png?v=1603143606" alt="" width="305" height="365" style="float: left;">First up, these traditionally-coloured <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/juicy-drop-candy-canes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>JuicyDrop Candy Canes</strong></a> that don’t have anything but traditional flavours!

<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>

<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Place settings</h2>
<p class="p1">When it comes to creative decorating for the holidays, it’s all in the details and the small things. Those are the ideas that your family or guests will remember! Place settings make a person feel welcomed, planned for, and invited. Seeing their name displayed creatively will make them feel as jolly as the day will be!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Ribbon candy –</strong> In this photo for example, the creator <a href="https://sugarandcloth.com/diy-watercolor-candy-ribbon-place-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin</a> shows us how to work with ribbon candy and snap them a certain way so you can use them as place cards… So clever!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sugarandcloth.com/diy-watercolor-candy-ribbon-place-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_4.15.09_PM_480x480.png?v=1603143941" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Candy Cane Place Settings –</strong> And there’s also using candy canes as place settings in a very clever (and tasty!) way. Check it out!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.cleanandscentsible.com/free-printable-christmas-place-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_4.15.56_PM_480x480.png?v=1603144053" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Making a candy wreath</h2>
<p class="p1">There are so many ideas of how to use candy to make real smart wreaths! The best part about them is that they also make an amazing edible gift!</p>
<p class="p1">Look at this super easy to make <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=airheads+taffy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Airheads Taffy</strong></a> wreath by <a href="https://www.HappinessIsHomemade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HappinessIsHomemade.com</a>, and all you need is a glue-gun, some cardboard, and of course lots of tasty Airhead candies!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.happinessishomemade.net/airheads-christmas-candy-wreath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_4.40.46_PM_480x480.png?v=1603144168" alt=""></a> </p>
<p class="p1">You can also create yummy candy wreaths by using <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/starlight-mints-hard-candy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Peppermint Starlight Mints Hard Candy</strong></a> (at Candy Funhouse we sell the 1.8kg bag!) or just use a whole bunch of different candy and make a super colourful, happy, bright and sweet wreath, like this one by <a href="https://www.onecrazymom.com/how-to-make-a-candy-wreath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneCrazyMom.com</a>! The idea for creating them is basically the same, you’re only limited by the amount of candy you buy online from us!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.onecrazymom.com/how-to-make-a-candy-wreath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_4.47.16_PM_480x480.png?v=1603144321" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h2 class="p1">Go ahead, create a Christmas candy buffet! </h2>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_5.24.12_PM_480x480.png?v=1603144402" alt="" width="293" height="304" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes it’s about creating a focal point that your guests can look at, and indulge in! Most people will gather at the kitchen, so why not use your dining table or a kitchen counter to create a whimsical and sweet candy buffet for Christmas?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s all about combining sizes and contrasting flavours, and displaying them in different jars, dishes and bowls.</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_5.23.54_PM_480x480.png?v=1603144458" alt="" width="383" height="362" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1">Candy Funhouse has simplified the candy buffet by organizing our huge selection by colour. So if your Christmas candy buffet is going to be red and green, simply search for “red candy” or “green candy” and voila! You can then pick and choose which candy you’d like to buy online and we’ll deliver for you in time for the holidays… All you need are the dishes to display candies out on!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">We love having good relationships with other people who are special to us, and that’s why it’s so important to show our appreciation. Whether with a smile, a simple thank you note, a hug, or a special little gift, letting someone know you’re thinking of them and you care can make life that much sweeter – for both them and you!</p>
<p class="p1"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.20.22_PM_480x480.png?v=1603135250" alt="gift giving candy funhouse" width="525" height="340"></p>
<p class="p2">Candy Funhouse knows that it’s sometimes difficult to know how to share your appreciation for others. Sometimes it seems they have everything, or that somehow gifting them a sweater or some flowers will not reflect how much you care for them. Instead, consider candy as a gift, just because at Candy Funhouse we are specialists on gift-giving, and we have the best of online shopping right here for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Candy makes a great gift because there is something for everyone on your gift-giving list. Whether for their birthday, Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, for Thanksgiving, or even for Christmas, where the gift of candy goes back centuries as the perfect gift idea for anyone! <strong>Check it out:</strong></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/845410161270092652/" target="_blank" title="Christmas tree candy ideas by Tyler Hensley" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/chistmasTreeIdeas_480x480.jpg?v=1603133076" alt="christmas tree ideas" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; float: left;"></a></div>
<p class="p1">In medieval times, many Europeans had the tradition of adorning their Christmas trees with food: Wafers, cookies, even fruits and licorice were customary decorations to use.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s face it, candy was a delicacy and a treat even then, it was very special! And a great time of year for enjoying candy was when everyone got together to celebrate.</p>
<p class="p1">There are many more delicious candies you can hang on a Christmas tree, like these:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/pez-christmas-ornament-with-mini-dispenser" target="_blank" title="pez christmas" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PEZ Christmas Ornament with Mini dispensers:</strong> </a>What a great idea for starting out a Christmas tradition! They're peanut-free, gluten-free, and they look so good on a tree!</p>

<h2 class="p1">Birthday sweetness</h2>
<p class="p1">Same goes for birthdays: Sure, you may look forward to the gifts and the cake, but candy is always KING! Wouldn’t you like to get one of these gifts for your birthday? We’re sure you would!</p>
<p class="p1"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_2.55.26_PM_480x480.png?v=1603133755" alt="birthday party candy treats" width="518" height="345" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p class="p1">Take a look at this child’s birthday party candybar, pictured above. It’s clean, simple, oh so pretty in pink! And you would really have to do so little to make it look amazing. It would be as simple as decorating with a lovely white or pink  tablecloth, a pink or fuchsia cake, and some white dishes with the following candies:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/haribo-chamallows-uk" target="_blank" title="haribo chamallows candy funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Haribo Chamallows:</strong></a> Deliciously soft and fluffy pink and white marshmallows, from the UK! (And when you're gifting them, you BET they probably have never tried such good candies!). </p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/haribo-chamallows-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.00.22_PM_240x240.png?v=1603134038" alt="haribo chamallows candy funhouse" width="174" height="220"> </a><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/gustafs-pink-lemonade-laces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.02.35_PM_240x240.png?v=1603134177" alt="gustafs pink lemonade laces" width="205" height="123"></a> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_3.06.40_PM_240x240.png?v=1603134426" alt=""></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/gustafs-pink-lemonade-laces" target="_blank" title="pink lemonade laces licorice" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gustafs Pink Lemonade Laces –</a> Not only they are deliciously refreshing, but they make a great gift since they're SUCH FUN! Don't they look pretty in pink? You could even spell out words on the party table with them... and then eat them! </p>
<p class="p2">Candy Funhouse also carries lots of other PINK and WHITE candies to complete the gift-giving idea for your favourite person's party...

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate and give thanks to people in our lives. Whether to your spouse for making this a special year, to your kids for being so supportive, or even to a friend or boss who has been especially awesome with you! Why not give a sweet candy thanks this year?</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine being on the receiving end: There is something very special about getting a candy basket filled with treats! You can send someone a card (and those are always nice to get!) but don’t forget that the gift of candy makes everyone smile.</p>
<h2 class="p2"><strong>Here are some ideas that will make them smile and truly feel your gift of thankfulness:</strong></h2>
<h3 class="p1"><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=chocolate" target="_blank" title="chocolate lover Candy Funhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the chocolate lover:</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Some people are just the chocolate-lovin’ kind. For them, why not pick a brand like Valor and gift them a chocolate variety? You can select from Dark Chocolate Truffle Cream, the Orange Cream, and a Milk Chocolate Sugar-Free, sweetened with Stevia and perfectly healthy!</p>
<p class="p1">Milka is another delicious brand of candy bars that offer a variety of flavours, like DarkMilk with Almonds, Bubbly White Chocolate, Brownie Chocolate, or Medley – a delightful medley of dark chocolate chips, biscuits and fudge pieces. Which ones would they eat first, or maybe they’d have a square off each!</p>

<p class="p1">Kids may be just about the sweetest reason to celebrate Thanksgiving. Don’t forget to send them a little ‘thank you’ candy!

<p class="p1"> </p>
<h3 class="p1">For the Tree Hugger – or for everyone, really!</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s face it: A tree hugger still loves their candy, they just don’t like the way in which it’s wrapped! Say a big ‘thank you’ to them this Thanksgiving by showing them you appreciate their efforts to be more eco-conscious, and wrap their candy gift in some fabric! Check out this <a href="https://www.bhg.com/christmas/gift-wrapping/wrap-gift-with-fabric/" target="_blank" title="better homes video fabric wrap" rel="noopener noreferrer">video from Better Homes &amp; Garden</a> to learn how you can easily do this:</p>

<p class="p2">At Candy Funhouse, we’re sure you have some people in your life who seem to have everything they’d ever want, right? It’s difficult to have a Thanksgiving get together when you’re having to ‘social distance’ this year… Instead, think CANDY gift giving, and make everyone realize how thankful you are to have them in your life!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>If there is such a thing as a best time of year for candy, it’s Halloween!</strong> We all have great memories about trick or treating, and especially about going home and dumping the stash we collected on the table to sort out... and start devouring!</p>

      <![CDATA[Are you planning a Retirement Party for a loved one – or maybe even for yourself? Make it even sweeter by having a themed retirement candy table! Here are some great ideas to make the celebration even sweeter!<p><a class="read-more" href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/make-your-retirement-party-a-sweet-one">More</a></p>]]>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Congratulations! You’ve reached that outstanding stage in your life when you are able to officially retire… That’s amazing! This is certainly cause for celebration!</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you’re planning your own retirement party, or someone else’s, it’s a well-deserved time to have a few family and friends over to cheer! Chances are you may have the party in your own backyard, at a country club, favourite restaurant, or a family member’s home… and now that you’ve decided on the venue, it’s time to decide what this party will look like!</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-08-13_at_1.03.49_PM_large.png?v=1597338258" alt="Happy Retirement Party" width="536" height="241" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #9900ff;"><strong>What’s the Theme?</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1">For many retirees, a retirement party is always best celebrated with a ‘Theme’ in mind. Sometimes the retiree wants to move down south, spend more time golfing, travel to Europe, or take on the outdoors… and all of these offer a great opportunity for party themes!</p>
<p class="p1">For example, you can host a “Golf Party”, where all your guests must wear comfortable golf attire including golf shoes, a putting green in the backyard, coloured flags with stations (one for food, one for drinks, one for sitting and chillin’), and you can easily complement this with a candy buffet table! What does this look like?</p>
<p class="p1">A table would have photos of the retiree, golf balls in various colours and in various glass containers, coloured flags with numbers representing the retiree’s years of work, and of course, CANDY! </p>
<p class="p1">Or how about a retirement celebration for a banker, financial advisor, or accountant? Imagine what a fun candy loot bag would look like if it were filled with gold and silver themed candy? We have all that readily available at Candy Funhouse!</p>
<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #9900ff;"><strong>Here are some great ideas for your Candy Buffet Retirement Party table:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Money Money Money! </strong>Rather than have the newly retired guest of honour worry if they have enough money to retire, why not host a "money money" party? Include candy like<strong> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/gold-mine-gum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Mine Nugget Bubble Gum</a></strong>, which are<strong> </strong>not only nostalgic and will bring them back memories from the past, but a great send-off into retirement! Or how about <strong><a href="&lt;p%20class=%22p3%22&gt;&lt;span%20class=%22s1%22&gt;&lt;a%20href=%22https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/milk-chocolate-loonies%22&gt;https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/milk-chocolate-loonies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;%20&lt;p%20class=%22p4%22&gt;%C2%A0&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milk Chocolate Loonies</a> </strong>– Of course! These novelty candies are a must at every retirement party! When many retirees are wondering if they have enough money to retire, they will feel at ease with the look of these golden, sweet babies!</li>
<li>
<strong>Old-Fashioned Candy –</strong> Bring them back to their childhood and to good memories, with Candy Funhouse’s large collection of nostalgic candies! Simply search for “old fashioned candy” “nostalgic candy” or “retro candy” and check out the huge selection! Some favourites include <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/rock-candy-sticks-assorted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock Candy Sticks</a>, Old-Fashioned Hard Candies such as this <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/claeys-root-beer-old-fashioned-hard-candies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Root Beer Hard Candy by Claeys</a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/taveners-fruit-drops-200g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taveners Fruit Drops</a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/popeye-candy-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popeye Candy Sticks</a>… remember those? <em>Of course you do!</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Candy by the decade</strong> – We’ve also put them all together for you by the decade… So you can select Top Candies from the <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/top-12-candies-from-the-1940s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1940s</a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/top-12-candies-from-the-1950s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1950s</a>, <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/top-12-candies-from-the-1960s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1960s</a> and so on… The newly retired person will just love reminiscing on some of their childhood favourites!</li>
<li>
<strong>Candy by the colour –</strong> When you’re hosting a party, whether it’s for a birthday, wedding, baby shower, and a certainly for a retirement party, colour themes are a must! They make for eye-catching and memorable celebrations, which is what you are aiming for at a retirement party. At Candy Funhouse, we have tagged all our candy by colour sections, so that is easily something you can search for on our website. Maybe it’s a <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=blue+candy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue-themed</a> party for a Blue Jays Baseball fan, or a <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=green+candy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green-themed</a> party for an avid gardener… or why not host a <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=red+candy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red-themed</a> party if it happens to fall on Canada Day? The possibilities are endless!</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"> <a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/pages/search-results-page?q=retro+candy" target="_blank" title="Shop Retro Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/reto-candy-homepage_10ca6509-3a41-4368-bdc8-2289d3898ea8_large.jpeg?v=1570475324" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<p class="p5">Turning 50, 60, or 70+ years of age doesn’t mean that a sweet tooth is going to fade away! On the contrary, when someone retires, they are looking at reinventing their life to a new phase of doing all those things they want to do, not just what they ‘must’ do! Candy is a sweet reminder of one’s childhood, comfort food enjoyment, and celebration! At Candy Funhouse we have all the sweets and treats to make that retirement party even jollier than ever!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally introduced in 1932, this American Chocolate Bar used to be filled with vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate flavours to be the “3 Muskteers”.

They first bade their debut in 1941 by the inventor, Forrest Mars. While serving in the civil war in Spain, Mars noticed British soldiers eating handfuls of round candy. This inspired his own creation, which happened to be the M&amp;Ms Chocolate Candy that we all drool over. Interestingly, M&amp;Ms are given to soldiers during WW2 as they would not melt and served as an excellent source of protein and energy for exhausted soldiers. The US Army quickly became the M&amp;Ms largest customer, and since then, M&amp;M candies have been apart of our lives. This chocolate sensation is now known worldwide and continues to create new and exciting editions of this 40s retro candy.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wasnt life simple back in the 1950s? Throwback to the good days of rock n roll, when Elvis and the Everley Brothers dominated the radio. With only 3 TV channels, there wasn’t much choice. However, there was so much sweet candy to savour at the nearby candy store. Remember buying retro candy like </span><a href="http://candyfunhouse.ca/products/giant-pixy-stix"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pixy Stix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/charleston-chew-strawberry?_pos=1&amp;_sid=eb4625e85&amp;_ss=r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charleston Chew</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other nostalgic retro candy for only 5 cents? Every candy lover can still enjoy 50s candy such as Candy Necklaces, </span><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bubble-gum-cigarettes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubble Gum Cigarettes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Atomic Fireballs.</span><b> Thankfully, at Candy Funhouse discover a 1950s candy shop right at your fingertips. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which 50s candy is your all-time favourite?

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy Our Favourite Top 12 Candies from the 1950s<br></span></h2>
<p><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/atomic-fireball"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1. ATOMIC FIREBALL</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">This cinnamon hot flavoured old fashioned candy is as hot as jalapenos! The Ferrara Candy Company invented Atomic Fireballs in 1954, alongside Lemonheads. Atomic Fireballs have a revolutionary flavour due to its manufacturing process. Sugar is heated under a gas flame, and as a sweet liquid is added, the hard candy begins to form. This process is repeated over 100x before an atomic fireball is created! These atomic fireballs are a lot to handle, but a fan favourite amongst spicy candy lovers. Will you try this spicy retro candy? Buy atomic fireballs at our 1950s candy store.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/candy-necklace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2. CANDY NECKLACE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to this 1950s candy, we can still wear our candy! The 1950s featured many playful candies. The genius behind a candy necklace still remains a mystery today. The rumour is that Candy Necklaces were invented in Europe, and quickly made their way across the pond. Candy Necklaces feature pastel candies secured by an elastic string that can be worn as a necklace. Little girls loved receiving candy necklaces as Halloween Candy and for birthday celebrations. Relieve nostalgic moments with classic candy necklaces.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/bubble-gum-cigarettes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#3. BUBBLE GUM CIGARETTES</span></a></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blow clouds of sugar with these bubble gum cigarettes! These candy cigarettes are a 50s classic candy that is remarkably still available today. While cigarettes are not as popular as they once were, reminisce about your childhood with Bubble Gum Cigarettes with 10 candy cigarettes in each pack. In the 21st century, candy cigarettes are prohibited in many countries including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Norway for example. However, candy cigarettes are still available online at your favourite 1950s candy shop! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/lucky-elephant-pink-candy-popcorn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4. LUCKY ELEPHANT PINK CANDY POPCORN </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This colourful popcorn truly completes a 1950s candy shop! Surprisingly, this delicious caramel popcorn is topped with a colourful pink colour. No need to wait for the next fair or carnival to enjoy pink candy popcorn, instead order it online. These sweet, pink candy-coated popcorns can be enjoyed by all age groups!

Remember the first time you tried this toothsome treat? Sunline Inc created this lovable treat in 1952 in St Louis. Before Pixy Stix, Sunline created a sugar to mix with water. However, kids wouldn’t mix it with water, and instead would enjoy the powdered candy. That is how we came to have the Pixy Stix that we all love and enjoy. Interestingly, Pixy Stix gave way to the creation of Sweet Tarts and Lik-M-Aid, other retro candy favourites.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong></strong>It’s no secret: Kids love candy, and if you’re having a candy buffet party or it’s their birthday and you want to celebrate by ordering some specialty candy online, it’s sometimes difficult to know what is best to get for them!</p>
<p class="p2">We especially worry about those kiddos with allergies! Of course, every small child should be monitored constantly to make sure they’re putting the safest goodies in their mouths, and candies are no exception. We got you parents!! And we’re sharing our safest candies for kids with you, so you can have some peace of mind! </p>
<p class="p2"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.25.08_PM_medium.png?v=1594754730" alt="girl candy" width="427" height="325" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Allergens in candies</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There are some candies that pose a threat to children with allergies, as they may contain the recognized “top 8 allergens”. Those allergens can include milk, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat or gluten in general, soybean, fish, shellfish and eggs. These food allergens must legally be clearly declared on any candy label, as they account for 90% of all food allergens.</p>
<p class="p1">The safest candies that have no allergens include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/products/skittles-original-candies-61-5g" target="_blank" title="skittles" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skittles</strong></a> – These flavours are safe from the top 8 allergens: Original, sour, wild berry, tropical, orchards, and Desserts flavours.<br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.27.23_PM_medium.png?v=1594754863" alt="">

<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Vegan and vegetarian safe candies:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It’s no secret that vegans and vegetarians love to eat as much as the next person, and candies are no exception!</p>
<p class="p2">There are some candies which aren’t suitable for vegans as they may be made using ingredients such as gelatin, carmine, lard, confectioners glaze, bone char, milk, eggs, or honey. The following are amazingly enjoyable candies which you CAN have, if you’re vegan or vegetarian, as they do not contain any of these top 8 allergens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airheads Taffy</li>
<li>Dots</li>
<li>Dum Dums</li>
<li>Ferrara Atomic FireBalls</li>
<li>Ferrara Chocolate Wafer Swirls</li>
<li>Cry Baby Candy</li>
<li>Fruit by the Foot</li>
<li>Haribo Sour S’ghetti Gummi Candy</li>
<li>Hubba Bubba Gum</li>

<li>Joyva Chocolate Covered Orange and also Raspberry Ring Jells</li>
<li>Jujubes</li>
<li>Jujyfruits</li>
<li>Lemonheads</li>
<li>Mary Jane Candy</li>
<li>Sour Patch Kids</li>
<li>Skittles</li>
<li>Smarties</li>
<li>Sweet Tarts</li>
<li>Tic Tac Mints</li>
<li>Twizzlers</li>
<li>Velamints</li>
<li>Zots</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/Screen_Shot_2020-07-14_at_3.38.15_PM_medium.png?v=1594755516" alt="" width="458" height="309" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Safest candies for small children:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Although enjoying candies on a regular basis is probably not the best thing for small toddlers, if they are over 2 years old you can give them the occasional treat – as long as it’s kid-safe, allergen-free, and not a choking hazard! Never give your small child any hard candies, at least until they turn 4 years old – and even then, monitor them while they’re tasting it, and learning how to eat it! So basically that means, sitting down to eat it… not ever running around with candy in their mouths!</p>
<p class="p1">Also unsafe for little ones are things like candy corn, pumpkin or sesame seeds, and gummy candy, taffy and caramel, because they can easily slip down their throat, causing them to choke. </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>So what is safest?</strong> Soft candies are probably the safest you can occasionally give your toddler to enjoy. Goodies like cotton candy, milk chocolate bars, peanut butter cups, and chocolate-covered peppermint patties are pretty safe, as long as they’re pre-cut in tiny pieces, and you’re cleared for any allergic reactions to the top 8 allergens mentioned above, like peanuts/nuts, dairy, gluten, and eggs. <em><strong>Always let your kids taste it WITH YOU, never alone or unattended!</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">The relationship kids will develop with candy can be a sweet and rewarding one, and there is a candy for everyone’s tastes, and even cultures! Check out the extensive candy collections we have at Candy Funhouse, and start picking some of your children's favourites for their next party! Make theirs a memorable one –make it something they’ll remember fondly for years to come!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Which candies do you remember having as a child? Candy Funhouse wants to know!</strong></p>

Read on...<p><a class="read-more" href="https://candyfunhouse.ca/blogs/around-the-funhouse/chocolate-healthy-comfort-food">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">At <strong>Candy Funhouse</strong> we recognize everyone has a particular ‘comfort food’ they turn to when they’re feeling a little ‘blah’. For some people it may be they’re craving a gooey grilled cheese sandwich, while for others it’s a warm bowl of mom’s homemade stew... Yet everyone also seems to crave a particular type of sugary treat when feeling down – <em>why is that?</em></p>
<p class="p1">Hundreds of studies have been conducted, and hundreds of thousands spent on finding out one basic result: Candy makes us feel good!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eating sweets activates the brain’s reward system – such as with chocolate, which can actually trigger the body’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins" target="_blank" title="What are endorphins?" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorphins</a> (AKA the ‘feel good’ hormone) to decrease stress and pain. Why do we need to know this? Because eating treats like chocolate may actually be good for you! <strong>How’s that for uplifting news?!!!</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0250/7483/files/CandyFunHouse_Chocolate_large.png?v=1592841947" alt="candy funhouse chocolate online" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p2">Comfort food gives us that nostalgic connection; it works as an anti-depressant, plus it tastes sooo good… And Candy Funhouse has something for everyone, regardless of age, culture, or sweet preference. One of our favourites: Dark chocolate.</p>
<p class="p1">Dark chocolate is basically made of cacao beans, sugar, soy lecithin (for preserving texture) and other flavourings. This dark cacao contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol" target="_blank" title="What is Resveratrol?" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>resveratrol</i></a> (hey, just like wine!) an antioxidant and immune system booster that may even help reduce blood pressure and increase arterial blood flow, and lower <a href="https://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/risk-and-prevention/condition-risk-factors/managing-cholesterol" target="_blank" title="What is LDL?" rel="noopener noreferrer">LDL</a> (bad) cholesterol. Feeling better about indulging in chocolate now, aren’t you?</p>
<p class="p2">The body is an amazing machine, and it knows when something is missing or needed. Just like when you’re thirsty and craving a big glass of water, it knows when you just gotta have that little something sweet for comfort. The key here is, everything in moderation, and when you’ve just gotta have that sweet kick, dark chocolate may just be the best choice for you!</p>
<p class="p1">Candy tops the list of comfort foods because of our amazing ability to link scent and memory – like how the scent of popcorn may remind us of family movie nights, or the memory of a county fair with the smell of a pie baking in the oven. Let’s face it, there is something incredibly comforting about the scent of chocolate!</p>
<p class="p1">Most of us have grown up with chocolates as treats in one way or another. Do you remember the feeling of finding a mini Hershey’s packed in your lunch bag? Or organizing your M&amp;M’s into colours, then seeing if they actually melted in your hand? Let’s not forget how many of us were first introduced to chocolate: Poured into a glass of cold milk… It’s childhood in a glass! </p>
<p class="p1">If chocolate is your ‘thing’, at Candy Funhouse we have it all sorted out for you in specific sections, whether you’re looking for a specific or unusual chocolate bar, a nice chunk of smooth fudge, or if you’re looking for a particular chocolate from Britain, the States, or from right here at home in Canada. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a bit of chocolate here and there, and now you have more reason to have it… Just for comfort!</p>
